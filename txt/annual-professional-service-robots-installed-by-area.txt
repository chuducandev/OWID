The bar chart presents data on the annual professional service robots installed, categorized by application area for the year 2021 on a global scale. It showcases the significant prevalence of robotics in the transportation and logistics sector, which outstrips other categories with 50,000 installations. This reflects a substantial increase from the previous year's figure of 34,000, highlighting a major growth area in the adoption of robotics.

The hospitality sector has also seen a notable rise, with installations doubling from 10,000 to 20,000, indicating an expanding role for robotics in this industry. Medical robotics installations have climbed to 15,000, up from 12,000, suggesting a growing reliance on robotics in healthcare environments for tasks such as surgery.

Professional cleaning has witnessed a more modest growth from 10,000 to 13,000, while the agriculture sector maintained a steady figure of 8,000 installations across both years, demonstrating stable but less dynamic engagement with robotics technology compared to the other sectors.

In summary, the data point to a burgeoning integration of robotics in service industries, particularly in transportation and logistics, and hospitality, which may signal shifting operational strategies and the evolution of work in those fields.

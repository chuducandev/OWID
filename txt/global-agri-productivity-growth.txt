The chart illustrates the different factors contributing to the growth in global agricultural production across five decades, beginning in the 1960s. It is apparent that the role of improvements in total factor productivity has become increasingly significant over time. In the 1960s, the largest contribution came from inputs per acre, like fertilizers and machinery, at 2.07%, while improvements in productivity accounted for only 0.14%. However, by the 2000s, total factor productivity improvements were the most substantial contributor at 1.9%, overshadowing inputs per acre, which had fallen to a mere 0.12%. The reliance on expanding more agricultural land and irrigation has generally declined or remained stable over the decades, with land expansion peaking in the 1960s at 0.48% and irrigation in the 1970s at 0.28%. Additionally, the 1990s marked a notable increase in productivity growth to 1.57%, highlighting a significant shift towards efficiency and better management practices in agriculture.

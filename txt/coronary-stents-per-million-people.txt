The provided data showcases the number of coronary stent implantations per million people across various countries in 2016. France leads the chart with the highest rate of stent implantations at 4,075.2 per million people, indicative of a high level of access to this particular form of heart disease treatment within the country. This is followed by Italy and Sweden, with 3,635.2 and 3,455.0 stent implantations per million, respectively. On the lower end of the spectrum, Egypt has the fewest implantations with 1,164.7 per million, and Romania is slightly ahead with 1,295.7. Notably, countries like Denmark, Greece, Spain, and the United Kingdom have implantation rates that fall in a middle range, between 2,250.8 and 2,857.7 per million. Denmark, for instance, has a rate of 2,636.2, which is significantly lower than the leading countries but notably higher than Romania and Egypt. The data points underscore a marked disparity in the use of coronary stents within European countries compared to Egypt, possibly reflecting differences in healthcare systems, prevalence of coronary artery diseases, or both.

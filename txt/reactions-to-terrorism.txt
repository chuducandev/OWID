The chart illustrates the decline in willingness among U.S. citizens to participate in various activities from 2001 to 2017 due to concerns about terrorism. In 2001, a significant number were less willing to travel overseas (48%), fly on aeroplanes (43%), go into skyscrapers (35%), and attend large events (30%). However, by 2011, all figures had dropped, indicating an increased reluctance, with only 38% willing to travel overseas, 24% to fly, 20% to enter skyscrapers, and 27% to attend large events. Notably, there was a rebound in 2017, with a rise in willingness to travel overseas (46%), fly (32%), and attend large events (38%), but a slight decrease for skyscrapers (26%). This suggests a gradual recovery in the public's confidence to engage in these activities, despite the initial steep decline in the early 2000s.

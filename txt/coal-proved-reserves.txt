The chart shows coal reserves data for the year 2020 for the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) excluding its code, Kazakhstan (KAZ), and Turkey (TUR), as measured in metric tonnes (Mt). The CIS holds the largest coal reserves among the entities listed, with a staggering 190.66 billion tonnes, greatly overshadowing its counterparts. Kazakhstan's coal reserves stand at a substantial 25.61 billion tonnes. Turkey's reserves are the smallest of the three, with 11.53 billion tonnes. These figures are indicative of the vast disparities in coal reserves across different regions, with the CIS's reserves being an order of magnitude larger than those of Kazakhstan and Turkey combined. The reserves represent quantities that are expected to be economically recoverable in the future under current operational conditions and technological capabilities.

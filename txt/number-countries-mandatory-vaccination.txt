In 2019, the global landscape of childhood vaccination policies was categorized into three groups based on the stringency and enforcement of regulations regarding childhood vaccinations. Eighty-nine countries had a mandatory vaccination policy imposing the requirement of vaccinations without necessarily emphasizing school enrollment. A smaller fraction of countries, numbering 33, opted for a less forceful approach, merely recommending vaccinations rather than enforcing them through legal means. Additionally, 20 countries specifically mandated vaccinations as a precondition for school entry, using access to education as a lever to ensure compliance with public health goals. This differentiation in policies underscores a diverse approach to public health strategy concerning childhood vaccinations across different nations. The overwhelming majority of the countries had some form of compulsion, either directly or indirectly linked to education, suggesting a significant global endorsement of the importance of childhood vaccinations.

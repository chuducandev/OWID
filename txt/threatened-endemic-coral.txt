The chart presents data on the number of threatened endemic reef-forming coral species by country, using the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria for the year 2020. According to the chart, the United States has the highest number of threatened endemic reef-forming coral species with 3 species considered at risk. Both Indonesia, Japan, and Madagascar follow with 2 species each at risk of extinction. Mexico has 1 species at risk. Notably, Australia, Brazil, and Ecuador do not have any endemic reef-forming coral species categorized as threatened. Endemic species are those that are native to a specific geographic location and are often at a greater risk of extinction due to their limited distribution. The chart underscores that some regions are experiencing significant threats to their unique coral species, which are critical to marine biodiversity and ecosystem health.

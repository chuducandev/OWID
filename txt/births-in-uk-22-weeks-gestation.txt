The chart displays the number of live births at or under 22 weeks gestation in England and Wales over a three-year period from 2014 to 2016. In 2014, the total number of live births was recorded at 137 for those at 22 weeks gestation and significantly fewer births, under 22 weeks gestation. This trend of increasing live births continues over the following years. In 2015, there was an increase in live births at 22 weeks gestation to 160 and even more pronounced increase in the births under 22 weeks gestation. The year 2016 saw the highest numbers within this period: live births at 22 weeks gestation rose to 191, and those under 22 weeks saw a substantial rise as well. It is notable that while both categories increased, the live births under 22 weeks gestation saw larger increments annually. This data underlines a significant rise in extremely preterm births in England and Wales, where the viability threshold at 23 weeks is typically defined, and where according to the chart, live births prior to this threshold showed consistent growth over the studied period.

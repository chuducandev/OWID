The chart displays the estimated annual number of deaths from snakebite envenoming for the year 2019 in five different countries. India stands out with a significantly higher number of deaths at 51,100, reflecting a grave health issue relative to the other regions. Pakistan follows but with a much lower figure of 2,070 deaths, indicating that while it is an issue, it is not as severe as in India. Nigeria and Bangladesh have comparable numbers with 1,460 and 1,170 deaths, respectively. The Democratic Republic of Congo reports the lowest number of deaths among the listed countries, with 545 fatalities. This data underscores the need for medical interventions and preventive measures, especially in India where the impact of snakebite envenoming is substantially higher than in the other countries presented.

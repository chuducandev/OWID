The chart presents a hypothetical scenario for the year 2014, where global deaths attributable to energy production are estimated if the world's energy were produced by a single source. The most significant finding is that brown coal would lead to the highest number of deaths at approximately 5.2 million, reflecting its high environmental and health impact. Regular coal appears to be the second most hazardous with about 3.91 million deaths. Oil follows with nearly 2.93 million deaths, reinforcing the idea that fossil fuels carry a significant risk to human health. In contrast, nuclear energy stands out for its safety, with the estimated number of deaths being the lowest at just 11,766. Biomass and gas are responsible for fewer deaths than fossil fuels like coal and oil, with 736,170 and 448,539 deaths, respectively. This data implies a marked difference in the safety of various energy sources, highlighting the relatively low impact of nuclear energy compared to the high mortality associated with coal and oil.

The chart shows the annual CO2 emissions from deforestation by product in Brazil, noting that it reflects the carbon footprint of diets and is adjusted for trade for the average period from 2010 to 2014. Cattle meat (beef) production accounts for the vast majority of these emissions, with a staggering 466.3 million tonnes, overshadowing all other categories by a wide margin. Vegetables, fruits, and nuts come in a distant second with 11.85 million tonnes of CO2 emissions, followed closely by rice at 10.28 million tonnes. Oilseed products and sugar are also significant contributors, with 7.54 million tonnes and 6.62 million tonnes respectively. Other crops, wheat, and other cereals contribute smaller amounts, ranging from 5.09 million tonnes for other crops to 2.33 million tonnes for other cereals. Plant fibers are responsible for 1.13 million tonnes of emissions. Other meat products, interestingly, have no associated emissions listed in this data (0 tonnes). Overall, the data clearly illustrates the dominant impact of beef production on deforestation-related CO2 emissions in Brazil.

The chart presents the age-standardized mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution for the year 2019, expressed in deaths per 100,000 population. It compares the rates of four distinct countries. Sierra Leone exhibits the highest mortality rate with 239 deaths per 100,000, indicating a substantial impact of air pollution on public health. Nigeria follows with a substantially high rate of 165 deaths per 100,000, further highlighting the pressing nature of air pollution in certain regions. Moldova's mortality rate due to air pollution stands at 69 deaths per 100,000, which is notably lower than the rates in Sierra Leone and Nigeria, yet still significant. Finland presents the lowest rate among the sampled countries, with 7 deaths per 100,000, reflecting a comparatively better situation in terms of air quality-related health outcomes. The stark contrast between Finland's rate and that of Sierra Leone underscores the disparities in air pollution's impact on health across different parts of the world.

The chart presents an overview of the sources of air pollution in the UK, specifically PM2.5 emissions for the year 2016. It highlights that small non-road mobile sources and machinery are the largest contributor with 46,600 tonnes of emissions. Manufacturing industry and construction follow as the second largest source, contributing 17,400 tonnes. These two categories are notably more substantial than others. Industrial processes and road transport each generated significant emissions as well, at 13,900 and 13,400 tonnes respectively.

On the lower end of the emission sources, agriculture accounted for 4,300 tonnes, slightly more than non-road transport and waste, both of which contributed 3,700 and 3,600 tonnes respectively. Energy production matched waste emissions at 3,600 tonnes. The least contributing sources were fugitive emissions at 1,200 tonnes, military aircraft and naval shipping at 200 tonnes, and the 'other' category at a minimal 100 tonnes.

This data underscores the significant impact of small mobile sources and manufacturing on PM2.5 pollution levels. The chart suggests that efforts to reduce PM2.5 emissions in the UK could benefit from focusing on the top-emitting categories.

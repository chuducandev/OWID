The exclusive breastfeeding rate, reflecting the percentage of children under 6 months who were fed only breast milk in the past 24 hours, has shown varied trends in Angola and Colombia over the years, while only one data point is available for Venezuela. In Angola, the rate was significantly low at 11.0% in 2001 but saw a pronounced increase to 37.38% by 2016. Colombia, on the other hand, experienced fluctuations; after initially decreasing from 15.6% in 1986 to 11.5% in 1995, there was a substantial rise to 46.8% in 2005. However, the rate declined again to 36.67% by 2016. Venezuela's data point stands at a low 7.1% in 1998, but without additional data, trends cannot be determined. Overall, while the recorded exclusive breastfeeding rates in Angola and Colombia are above those noted in the earlier years, there appears to be a decrease in the recent years in Colombia indicating the need for sustained interventions to promote exclusive breastfeeding.

The chart illustrates the changes in alcohol consumption by type in Italy from 1890 to 2014. It demonstrates a significant shift in consumption patterns over the years. In 1890, wine dominated Italian alcohol consumption, comprising 95% of the total alcohol intake, whereas beer and spirits accounted for a mere 5% in total. This trend of wine predominance continued in 1929, with similar percentages. However, by 1964, there was a notable increase in spirits consumption to 10%, and beer to 3%, while wine consumption decreased to 87%. In the subsequent decades, the consumption of beer and spirits continued to rise; by 1984, beer reached 8% and spirits 12%, with wine at 80%. In 2014, the consumption patterns transformed further, with wine consumption dropping to 65% while beer consumption experienced a marked rise to 23%. Spirits consumption remained relatively stable, at 11%. The data indicates a diversification of Italian alcohol preferences over time, with beer emerging as a significant component of alcohol consumption by 2014, though wine remains the primary choice.

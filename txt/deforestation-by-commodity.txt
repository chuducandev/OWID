The chart presents data on annual tropical deforestation attributable to different agricultural products, measured as an average between 2010 and 2014. Cattle farming emerges as the leading cause, responsible for a striking forest loss of approximately 2.11 million hectares. It is followed by oilseeds and forestry logging, with significant forest losses of 950,609 hectares and 678,744 hectares, respectively. Other cereals excluding rice and wheat also contribute substantially to deforestation with 445,902 hectares lost. On the lower end of the scale, sugar cane or beet and wheat have the least impact on forest loss, accounting for 57,796 hectares and 53,342 hectares respectively. The impact of agriculture on deforestation is further illuminated by losses due to other crops (184,020 hectares), paddy rice (287,785 hectares), vegetables, fruit, and nuts (379,251 hectares), and plant-based fibers (25,297 hectares). The extensive deforestation linked to livestock and crop production highlights a major environmental challenge associated with these agricultural activities.

The chart presents data on the Global Warming Potentials (GWP-100) of various greenhouse gases relative to carbon dioxide (CO₂) over a 100-year timescale, as measured in 2021. Carbon dioxide sets the baseline with a GWP of 1.0. Methane (CH₄) has a GWP of 27.9, representing a nearly 28-fold increase in warming impact compared to CO₂. HFC-152a (CH₃CHF₂) has a markedly higher potential at 164 times that of CO₂. Nitrous oxide (N₂O) is even more substantial with a GWP of 273. The most potent greenhouse gases in this selection are perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride; PFC-14 (CF₄) exhibits an immense GWP of 7,380, while sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆) tops the chart with a staggering GWP of 24,300, indicating its warming impact is over 24,000 times greater than that of CO₂. This data underlines the significant variation in warming impact among different greenhouse gases, with some having the potential to cause dramatically more warming per unit mass than carbon dioxide

The chart displays per capita CO2 emissions from international passenger flights for selected countries in 2018, with adjustments made for tourism. The United Arab Emirates stands out with the highest emissions at approximately 1949 kg per capita, which is significantly more than the other nations. The United Kingdom follows with emissions of about 818 kg per capita. Australia is also relatively high on the list with around 612 kg per person. Emissions from Norway and Canada are more moderate, recorded at about 425 kg and 363 kg per capita, respectively. The United States has a considerably lower value of approximately 198 kg per capita. Spain has the least emissions among the listed countries, with roughly 77 kg per capita. Overall, the data suggests a wide variance in the tourism-adjusted carbon footprint of international air travel among these countries.

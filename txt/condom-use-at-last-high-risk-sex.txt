The chart presents data on condom use at last high-risk sex among adults aged 15-49 in different countries. It shows that in Haiti, a significant 58.9% of adults reported using a condom during their last non-marital, non-cohabiting sexual encounter in the year 2012. In contrast, Guatemala reported a lower percentage of 41% in 2015. The data points are not from the same year, which could indicate different time frames for the sexual health behavior measurement in each country, and the information for Sao Tome and Principe from the year 2009 is not visually represented in the chart. This data is crucial as it reflects the level of awareness and practice of safe sex measures in these regions, which is essential for preventing sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies. The source of the data is UNAIDS, as of 2023.

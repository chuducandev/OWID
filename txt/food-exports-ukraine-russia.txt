In 2019, Ukraine and Russia were significant contributors to global food exports with their largest crops displayed. Ukraine was particularly dominant in the sunflower oil market, commanding an impressive 42% share of global exports, more than twice that of Russia, which accounted for 21%. Corn (maize) exports saw Ukraine lead with a 16% share, a more distinct margin compared to Russia's 1.6%. However, wheat told a different story, with Russia leading at 14.2%, surpassing Ukraine's 8.9%. The two countries were almost even in barley exports, with Ukraine slightly ahead at 9.7% compared to Russia's 9.5%. Overall, despite Russia having a notable presence in the grain export market, Ukraine took a particularly strong lead in sunflower oil and maize, indicating their specialized roles in global agricultural supply chains during that year.

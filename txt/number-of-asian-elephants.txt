The chart illustrates the changing population of Asian elephants in India from 1980 to 2017. Starting with a population of 15,627 in 1980, there appears to be an overall upward trajectory despite some fluctuations. The population rose to 18,975 by 1985 and peaked at 29,391 in 2012, indicating a growth trend through this period. However, a significant dip to 15,604 was observed in 1993, after which the population recovered, reaching its zenith in 2012. Following the peak, there was a decline to 27,312 in 2017, reflecting a slight decrease in the latter five years. The overall increase from the initial count in 1980 to the latest in 2017 is indicative of growth in the Asian elephant population in India over the 37 years covered by the data, albeit with some years of decline that add complexity to the population dynamics. The highest population recorded in the chart was 29,391 in 2012, while the lowest was 15,604 in 1993. The data suggest that conservation efforts might have had positive effects, though the decline towards the end of the period signals potential challenges.

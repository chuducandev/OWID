The chart illustrates the total number of endemic amphibian species in select countries for the year 2020. Endemic species are those which are native to and found only within a specific region. Madagascar tops the list with the highest number of endemic amphibian species, numbering 312. This significant figure underscores Madagascar's unique biodiversity and highlights its potential importance for conservation efforts. China follows with 254 endemic amphibian species, showcasing its own considerable level of biodiversity. Indonesia also has a significant number of endemic amphibians at 213 species. The chart depicts a sharp drop in the number of endemic species for countries like South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo, reporting 52 and 50 species, respectively. Thailand and the Dominican Republic have distinctly lower numbers, with Thailand having 9 and the Dominican Republic having only a single endemic species. This data not only reflects the diversity of amphibian life in these countries but also raises awareness about the potential vulnerability of these species due to their limited geographic distribution.

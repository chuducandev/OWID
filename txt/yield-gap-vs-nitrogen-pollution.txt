The chart illustrates the relationship between nitrogen pollution and yield gap changes in various countries for the year 2020. Colombia stands out with the highest ratio, indicating a significant overapplication of nitrogen relative to its neighbors with an 81.56% difference, suggesting aggressive fertilizer usage without a corresponding increase in crop yields. El Salvador follows with a 49.44% nitrogen overapplication, reflecting a similar pattern. In contrast, countries like Kazakhstan and South Sudan display negative percentages, at -138.3% and -15.08% respectively, which implies they reduced their nitrogen usage more than their neighboring countries while still closing the yield gap. Interestingly, Malawi has a 0% difference, signifying that its nitrogen application was in line with yield gap changes when compared to its neighbors. Small differences are noticeable in Haiti and Lebanon, with 5.56% and 3.53% respectively, indicating relatively minor overuse of nitrogen. This data showcases disparities in agricultural practices related to fertilizer use and its efficiency among different countries.

The chart illustrates the decline in child labor rates among boys, girls, and overall in the United States over a period spanning from 1880 to 1930. In 1880, the incidence of child labor was 22.93% for all children, 32.5% for boys, and 12.2% for girls, indicating a significantly higher participation of boys in the labor force compared to girls. By 1900, child labor rates had decreased across the board, with the overall rate dropping to 16.53%, boys' rate to 26.1%, and girls' rate to 6.4%. The most notable reduction occurred by 1930, where the overall child labor rate further declined to 4.72%, with boys’ participation reduced to 6.4% and girls’ to a mere 2.9%. This data shows a significant reduction in child labor over five decades, with the rate for boys always remaining higher than that for girls. The downward trend reflects a combination of societal changes, economic shifts, and possibly the implementation of laws regulating child labor during that period.

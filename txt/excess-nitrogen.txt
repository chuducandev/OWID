The chart illustrates the total excess nitrogen from croplands for various countries in the year 2009. Excess nitrogen is defined as the difference between nutrient inputs and the amount harvested, indicating potential ecological harm. Notably, China had the highest excess nitrogen at approximately 24.65 million tons, substantially more than any other country listed. India was the second highest at around 13.48 million tons. The United States followed with a significant, yet comparatively lower amount of 8.02 million tons. Brazil and Mexico had 2.09 million and 1.61 million tons, respectively, while Indonesia contributed just over a million tons. The United Kingdom, South Africa, and Argentina had the least excess nitrogen figures with 361,607 tons for the UK, 357,144 tons for South Africa, and 244,424 tons for Argentina. The data underscores the disparity between countries, with China and India together exceeding the combined excess nitrogen of all the other countries featured in the chart.

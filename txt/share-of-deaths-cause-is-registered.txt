The chart presents data on the completeness of cause-of-death registration in various countries for different years. Germany, New Zealand, Russia, and the United States achieved a 100% completeness rate in capturing the underlying causes of death, indicating a fully functional vital registration system for the years recorded (2014, 2015, or 2016). Egypt follows closely with a high rate of 94% in 2015. On the other side of the spectrum, India has the lowest completeness rate at 10% for the year 2011, suggesting significant gaps in its death registration process. Most other featured countries have moderate completeness percentages, with China at 62% in 2015, Iraq at approximately 65% in 2016, and Nicaragua at roughly 79% in 2017. Malaysia and Qatar are at the lower end among these countries, with 52% in 2014 and 50% in 2017, respectively. These figures reflect the varying levels of development and effectiveness in the vital registration systems globally, illustrating disparities in health information infrastructure and the availability of crucial data on public health.

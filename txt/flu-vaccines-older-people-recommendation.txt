The chart presents data on the national policies for flu vaccination recommendations for older persons in Barbados and Malta from 2014 to 2020. In Barbados, a consistent policy recommending flu vaccinations for older persons was in place from 2014 through 2017. However, in 2019 and 2020, the policy shifted to no longer recommending these vaccinations for the older population. In contrast, Malta maintained a steady course throughout the seven-year span, consistently recommending flu vaccinations for older persons every year from 2014 to 2020. The chart illustrates a policy change in Barbados, while Malta's approach remained unchanged.

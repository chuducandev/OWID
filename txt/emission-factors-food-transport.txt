The graph depicts the emissions factor for temperature-controlled transport measured in kilograms of CO2 equivalent per tonne-kilometer for various transportation modes in the year 2010. Air transport emits the most with 1.13 kg CO2eq per tonne-kilometer, making it the least sustainable mode of transport in terms of CO2 emissions. On the other end of the spectrum, water transport is the most carbon-efficient, with emissions as low as 0.02 kg CO2eq per tonne-kilometer. Rail and road transportation fall in between, with rail being the greener option at 0.06 kg CO2eq per tonne-kilometer compared to the road's 0.4 kg CO2eq per tonne-kilometer. The data reflects a significant disparity between the modes of transport, highlighting a potential area for emission reduction by opting for more sustainable transportation methods, particularly in the logistics of food supply chains.

In 2023, the chart presents an overview of the number of national adaptation plans for climate change developed by two distinct groups: Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). National adaptation plans are important tools for identifying medium- to long-term climate adaptation needs and devising strategies to address them. The LDCs have taken a more proactive approach with 19 countries having established national adaptation plans. In comparison, SIDS have made a more modest advancement with 11 states having such plans in place. These figures highlight the ongoing efforts of vulnerable nations to prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The focus and commitment towards climate adaptation among these countries are becoming more pivotal considering their susceptibilities to climate-related events.

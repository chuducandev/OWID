I'm sorry, but there doesn't appear to be any detailed chart data provided in your message that lists entities, codes, years, or specific figures related to official development assistance to medical research and basic health sectors. The text only includes a description of net official development assistance along with a footnote on what constitutes official development assistance. Without the actual numerical data or a visual representation of the chart, I'm unable to summarize it. Could you please provide the specific chart data for analysis?

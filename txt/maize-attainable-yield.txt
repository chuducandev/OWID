The chart presents attainable crop yields for maize in four different countries for the year 2012. Attainable yields refer to the feasible crop production achievable with current technologies and management practices such as fertilization and irrigation. Notably, Lebanon stands out with a significantly higher attainable yield for maize, quantified at 9.32 tonnes per hectare, which is distinctly above the other listed countries. In contrast, Honduras, with an attainable yield of 4.36 tonnes per hectare, and Vietnam, with a closely related yield of 4.2 tonnes per hectare, exhibit moderate attainable yields. The Congo has the lowest attainable yield among the four countries, at 3.89 tonnes per hectare. This data underscores the variation in agricultural productivity for maize, which can be influenced by a multitude of factors including climate, technology adoption, and farm management practices specific to each region.

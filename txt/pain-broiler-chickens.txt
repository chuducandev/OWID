The chart outlines the estimated time two breeds of chickens raised for meat—an average fast-growing and a slower-growing breed—experience different levels of pain before reaching the same slaughter weight in their lifespan. The most severe level of pain, excruciating pain, is experienced for 30 seconds by fast-growing chickens, significantly more than the 6 seconds encountered by slower-growing chickens. When it comes to disabling pain, fast-growing chickens endure it for 3 days, which is three times longer than the 1 day of disabling pain slower-growing chickens face.

Both breeds spend considerable time in less severe forms of pain: hurtful and annoying pain. Fast-growing chickens suffer from hurtful pain for 20 days, while slower-growing chickens experience this pain for 15 days, which is 5 days less. For annoying pain, the duration is the same for slower-growing chickens but 1 day less for fast-growing chickens, with both encountering it for approximately 20 days. It is implied from the data that slower-growing chickens seem to have a somewhat better welfare in terms of reduced days spent in more significant levels of pain compared to their fast-growing counterparts.

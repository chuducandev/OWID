The chart presents the number of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) units per million people for various countries. Belgium stands out with the highest availability, at 5.3 units per million people in 2018. On the other end of the spectrum, Lebanon has significantly fewer units with only 0.4 per million in the same year. Greece and Italy have moderate availability, with Greece at 3.3 units in 2018 and Italy at 3.1 units, though the data for Italy is from 2015. Other countries fall between 1.1 and 2.1 units, with Spain and Sweden having relatively lower availability with 1.1 and 1.2 units per million in 2017, respectively, while Ireland has 2.1 units. Israel and Finland are near the lower end as well, with 1.5 and 1.4 units per million people respectively. Poland's data from 2015 shows a similar availability to Finland and Sweden, with 1.3 units. This data provides insight into the relative availability of cardiac MRI diagnostic capabilities per capita in these selected countries.

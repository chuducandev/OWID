I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The dataset itself is not provided in your message. The image you've shared contains the title of a chart and a description or definition of the metric being measured but does not include any specific data or numbers that would allow me to summarize the chart. For me to summarize a chart, I need the actual data points, such as the names of entities (countries, regions, etc.), years, and the corresponding percentages or values relating to the proportion of children achieving minimum proficiency in reading at the specified grade levels. Please provide the dataset with this information, and I'll be able to help with the summarization.

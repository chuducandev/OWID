The chart illustrates a steady increase in reported artificial intelligence incidents and controversies worldwide from 2012 to 2021. In 2012, the number of incidents stood at 10, which saw only a minor fluctuation until 2015 when it reached 14. A significant escalation occurred starting in 2016, with incidents jumping to 37, indicating a growing trend in AI-related controversies. This upward trajectory continued more sharply with 59 incidents in 2017, escalating to 82 in 2018. Notably, there was a substantial rise in 2019, with 123 incidents recorded.

However, it was in the last two years of the decade that the figures surged dramatically. In 2020, there were 218 AI incidents, depicting nearly a 78% increase from the previous year. The chart culminates with 260 reported incidents in 2021, highlighting the highest number within the displayed timeframe. This data suggests escalating concerns and challenges associated with AI technologies as they become more integrated into various aspects of society. It is important to note that this data does not include incidents from 2022 and is likely an undercount, hinting at the possibility that actual AI-related incidents may be even more prevalent.

The chart presents a historical overview of manuscript production in Germany from the 6th to the 15th century. It shows a notable increase in manuscript production over time, with no production recorded in the 5th and 6th centuries. The 7th century marks the commencement of production with 7,503 manuscripts. A significant leap is observed in the 9th century, with 59,771 manuscripts produced. As the centuries progress, the numbers continue to grow, reaching 49,548 in the 10th century and soaring to 166,876 by the 11th century.

The 12th and 13th centuries demonstrate a remarkable surge in production to 270,392 and 293,814 manuscripts, respectively. However, the most dramatic increase is seen in the 15th century, where production peaks at 515,116 manuscripts. This data strongly suggests a burgeoning intellectual and cultural development in Germany across these centuries, culminating in an extensive proliferation of manuscript production by the close of the Medieval period.

The chart presents the data on annual deforestation in China over 25 years, beginning from 1990 until 2015. In the initial year, 1990, deforestation was recorded at approximately 327,540 hectares. A decade later, in 2000, there was a slight decrease, bringing the number down to around 312,760 hectares. However, by 2010, there was an uptick in deforestation with about 329,970 hectares lost, marking the highest level of deforestation in the period displayed. Notably, a significant reduction happened by 2015, as the figure dropped dramatically to approximately 133,200 hectares, showing a substantial decrease in deforestation rates. The data suggest that while there was fluctuation in deforestation rates over the years, China made notable progress in reducing forest loss by 2015.

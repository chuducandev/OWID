The chart reviews the legal protections for women's land rights across four different countries over three years, measured on a scale of 1 to 6, where 6 represents the highest level of legal guarantees for equal rights to land ownership and/or control. Vietnam has the highest score among the listed countries, with a score of 4 in 2020, indicating a relatively stronger legal framework in place for the protection of women's land rights. Both Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe follow with a score of 3; Uzbekistan's data is from 2019 while Zimbabwe's is from 2020, hinting at a moderate level of legal guarantees. Yemen, with a score of 1 in 2021, has the lowest level of guarantees for women's equal rights to land ownership or control, suggesting minimal legal protection in this regard.

These scores are based on the presence of legal proxies such as compulsory registration of land, the need for spousal consent for land transactions, equal inheritance rights, financial incentives, explicit protection of women's land rights, and quotas for female participation in land management and administration institutions. Higher scores indicate a legal framework more conducive to ensuring women's equal rights in land ownership and control.

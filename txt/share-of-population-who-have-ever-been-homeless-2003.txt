In 2003, the proportion of the population who have experienced homelessness varied significantly across five surveyed countries, according to the data by Toro et al. (2007). The United Kingdom had the highest share, with 7.7% of its population having faced an episode of homelessness at some point in their lives. This was markedly higher than the United States, which had the second-highest rate at 6.2%. Italy followed with 4.0%, which is still substantial but notably less than the United Kingdom and the United States. Belgium had a lower prevalence of homelessness, with 3.4% of its population reporting an episode. Germany reported the lowest percentage among the listed countries, with 2.4% of its population experiencing homelessness. These statistics highlight divergent levels of homelessness within these European countries and the United States, drawing attention to the societal and policy differences that could contribute to such disparities.

The chart presents data on the global progress of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) implementation from 2017 to 2020. IWRM aims to coordinate the development and management of water, land, and related resources to optimize economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. Progress worldwide appears to be positive over the analyzed period. In 2017, the degree of IWRM implementation was at 49%, indicating that approximately half of the necessary management strategies were in place. By 2020, this figure had increased by 5 percentage points to 54%, showing a modest improvement in the adoption of IWRM practices globally. While the upward trend suggests advancements in water resources management, there is still significant room for progress, considering that the implementation level remains slightly above the halfway mark. Such data is critical for policymakers and stakeholders looking to evaluate the effectiveness and scale up the integration of water resource management to ensure sustainable practices.

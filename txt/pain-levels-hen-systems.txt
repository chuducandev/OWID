The chart illustrates the estimated number of days that an average hen experiences different levels of pain in various egg production systems throughout their laying life. Among the three systems, hens in battery cages undergo the most pain, with 420 days of annoying pain and 253 days of hurtful pain. They also endure 27 days of disabling pain, but only 0.003 days of excruciating pain, the latter being a negligible amount. Hens in furnished cages experience slightly less pain compared to those in battery cages, with 384 days of annoying pain and 197 days of hurtful pain. The occurrence of disabling pain drops to 10 days, while excruciating pain remains the same minuscule 0.003 days. Cage-free aviary systems seem to offer the most relief, as hens are expected to endure only 130 days of annoying pain and 109 days of hurtful pain. Disabling pain is the same as in furnished cages at 10 days, and excruciating pain is again virtually non-existent at 0.003 days. Overall, cage-free aviary systems appear to significantly reduce the duration of pain hens experience compared to caged environments.

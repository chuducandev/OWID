I'm sorry, but it seems there's been a mistake because the chart data you're referring to wasn't provided in your message. The image you shared contains information about the definition of stillbirths and the sources of data, but it doesn't include specific data or a chart that I could summarize for you. Please provide the chart data or describe the dataset for which you'd like a summarization, and I'll be happy to help.

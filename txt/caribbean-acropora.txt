The chart illustrates the decline of Acropora corals in the Caribbean from 1950 to 2007, highlighting two categories: where Acropora coral was dominant and where it was merely present. In 1950, a significant majority of reefs had Acropora coral as dominant (78%) and even more had them present (91%). However, over time there has been a dramatic decline in the presence and dominance of these corals. Specifically, by 1987, only 23% of the reefs had Acropora coral as dominant, and by 2002 the number dropped to a mere 4%. A similar trend is observed for the presence of Acropora coral, plummeting from 91% in 1950 to just 16% in 2002. By 2007, there was a marginal increase, with 6% of reefs having dominant Acropora coral and 19% having them present, but these figures still represent a dramatic decrease compared to the initial values recorded in 1950. The data suggests significant ecological changes in the Caribbean reefs due to factors such as water pollution, disease outbreaks, and coral bleaching events. This trend shows the vulnerability of coral ecosystems to environmental pressures and the potential for significant loss of coral

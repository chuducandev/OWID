The chart presents the percentage of food loss by food group as reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 2015. The data reveals that roots and tubers experience the highest post-harvest losses with a figure standing at 25.3%, indicating that a quarter of such produce is lost before it reaches consumers. Fruits and vegetables also see significant losses at 21.6%, suggesting that over a fifth of these perishable goods are not making it through the post-harvest processes effectively. Meat and animal products log a loss of 11.9%, while other unspecified food categories account for a 10.1% loss. Cereals and pulses appear to be the most efficient in terms of post-harvest retention, registering the lowest losses at only 8.6%. These insights point to the critical issue facing the perishable food groups, particularly roots and tubers and fruits and vegetables, as they move from farms to the consumer, highlighting the need for improved methods in handling, storage, processing, transport, and distribution to reduce food loss.

The chart presents data on the excess phosphorous per hectare of cropland for seven different countries in 2009. China is shown to have the highest level of excess phosphorous at 28.03 kilograms per hectare, indicating a significant difference between phosphorous inputs and the amount harvested in crops. Pakistan follows with 21.3 kilograms per hectare, with Brazil not far behind at 19.75 kilograms. These three countries substantially exceed the excess phosphorous levels of the other nations represented in the chart. India and Mexico exhibit moderately high values, with India at 16.82 and Mexico at 16.36 kilograms per hectare. Australia's excess phosphorous level is considerably lower at 10.77 kilograms per hectare. Notably, both the United Kingdom and the United States have the lowest levels of excess phosphorous on the chart, with 5.17 and 6.44 kilograms per hectare, respectively, which suggests more balanced phosphorous management in these countries compared to the others. The data highlights a disparity in phosphorous use efficiency across these nations, raising concerns about the environmental impact of agricultural practices where excess phosphorous is most pronounced.

The chart presents the median accuracy of predictions in the free modeling category for the best-performing team in each year's Critical Assessment of Protein Structure (CASP) competition from 2006 to 2020. The measurement utilizes the best-of-5 Global Distance Test, which scores the similarity between a predicted protein structure and the actual structure, with a range of 0-100 (100 being the best score). There is a notable variability in the median accuracy through the earlier years, with a dip in scores observed around 2010 and 2012 when accuracy fell to 33.9% and 30.1%, respectively. A pivotal leap in prediction accuracy is seen in the years 2018 and 2020, where the median accuracy reaches 57.7% and a significant 87.0%, respectively. This dramatic improvement is attributed to the advances made by DeepMind's AlphaFold AI systems. The chart showcases not only the incremental progress in protein folding prediction over time but also how pivotal advancements in AI can lead to substantial improvements in scientific capabilities.

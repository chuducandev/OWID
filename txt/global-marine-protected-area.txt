In 2021, the total ocean area that was protected amounted to a modest 7.7%, leaving a vast majority, 92.3%, unprotected. When we break this down by zone, national waters had a higher percentage of protected areas, with 7% under protection. This contrasts starkly with international waters, or the high seas, where only about 0.72% was protected. The discrepancy between percentages of protected areas in national versus international waters is significant, given that international waters make up a substantial portion of the world's oceans. The unprotected portions are considerably larger for both zones, with national waters having 32% protected and 39% unprotected, while the high seas are predominantly unprotected at 60%, leaving a mere 1% incrementally more protected at 61%.

This data underscores the extensive work that remains to be done to safeguard oceanic regions, particularly the high seas, which are critical for biodiversity conservation but less regulated due to their international status.

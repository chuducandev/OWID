The chart presents data on endemic freshwater crab species across various countries as of 2020. Endemic species are those confined to a specific region, reflecting the country's unique fauna. The chart shows that China far surpasses other listed countries with a total of 214 endemic freshwater crab species, highlighting its significant biodiversity in this area. This is a considerable distinction, as the country with the next highest count, Thailand, has 89 species, less than half of China's total. Colombia and Indonesia also exhibit a rich diversity with 76 and 71 species, respectively. India follows relatively closely with 60 species. The contrast becomes sharper at the lower end of the spectrum, where Myanmar, Brazil, and South Africa have significantly fewer endemic species, with 24, 12, and 7 species respectively. The data indicates a wide range of endemic freshwater crab diversity, with China standing out for its particularly high number of species confined within its borders.

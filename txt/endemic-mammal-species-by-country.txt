The chart presents a comparison of the total number of endemic mammal species across several countries in the year 2020. Indonesia leads with the highest number of endemic mammals, counting 295 species, highlighting its rich biodiversity and the uniqueness of its ecological environment. Australia follows with 255 endemic species, showcasing the continent's vast array of indigenous wildlife, possibly due to its isolation and diverse habitats.

Madagascar, an island nation renowned for its unique fauna, reports 213 endemic mammal species, emphasizing the impact of island ecology in the evolution of distinct species. In a similar ecological vein, Brazil, with its extensive Amazon rainforest, has 203 endemic mammal species. Mexico and the Philippines have fewer endemic species at 152 and 133, respectively, but still show significant numbers indicative of unique biological heritage. The United States has the lowest number among this group with 104 species, which might be due to its less isolated and more diverse environmental interactions. The chart underscores the concentration of distinct mammalian biodiversity in certain isolated regions and countries, particularly on islands and in countries with large, undisturbed natural areas.

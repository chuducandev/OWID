The chart presents per capita CO2 emissions from domestic aviation in 2018 for various countries. The United States leads by a significant margin with emissions of 385.52 kg CO2 per capita. Australia follows with a notably lower emission rate of 267.17 kg CO2 per capita, yet still prominently higher than the other countries listed. France and Sweden exhibit closer figures, at 69.67 kg and 54.77 kg CO2 per capita respectively, positioning them moderately on the chart. The United Kingdom, however, registers the lowest emissions among the displayed countries, with only 22.48 kg CO2 per capita. It can be inferred from the data that there is substantial variability in per capita domestic aviation CO2 emissions among these countries, with the United States having more than seventeen times the emissions of the United Kingdom.

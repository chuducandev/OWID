The chart illustrates the evolution of the gender wage ratio across different income percentiles in the United States from 1980 to 2010. It measures the raw female-to-male wage ratio. A notable trend is the general upward movement in wage equality, with the fiftieth percentile showing the most significant progress. In 1980, women in the tenth percentile earned 64.8% of what men did, which increased to 81.5% by 2010. Similarly, the median (fiftieth percentile) women's earnings rose from 60.1% of men's earnings in 1980 to 82.4% in 2010, marking the highest gain among the percentiles. However, for the ninetieth percentile, the wage ratio saw an initial rise from 62.4% in 1980 to 74.6% in 1989 before declining slightly to 73.9% by 2010, suggesting that higher-earning women did not maintain the gains experienced by those in the lower percentiles. This data points to a reduction in the wage gap, with the most pronounced strides towards equality in the median income group, while the gap remains wider at the higher end of the income spectrum.

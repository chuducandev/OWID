The chart presents the progression of health insurance coverage in Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom from 1910 to 1975. Starting with a moderate coverage of 44% in the year 1910, Germany experienced a steady rise to 72% by 1975. Italy, initially lagging significantly behind with only 6% coverage in 1910, made a remarkable leap to 91% by 1975, reflecting significant policy changes towards public health insurance. Sweden, with an initial coverage of 27% in 1910, achieved complete universal coverage by 1975. The United Kingdom, however, is only represented from 1935 onwards, but it demonstrates an impressive growth from 82% coverage in 1935 to total coverage in 1975. The upward trends for all countries indicate a clear direction towards enhanced public health insurance coverage over the 65-year period, with Sweden and the United Kingdom reaching full labor force coverage by the end of the period analyzed.

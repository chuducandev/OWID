The chart presents data on the number of threatened endemic bird species across various countries for the year 2020. Endemic species are those that are native and restricted to a particular geographical region, with such species often being at a higher risk of extinction due to their limited distribution. The information is sourced from the IUCN Red List of 2020. Indonesia stands out with the highest number of threatened endemic bird species, totaling 113. Brazil follows with 90 species deemed at risk. In contrast, Spain shows the least concern in this list with only 1 species being classified as threatened. Other notable countries include Madagascar with 29 species and Australia close behind with 27. India's count of threatened endemic bird species is 25, while China has a slightly lower figure of 18. South Africa is on the lower end of the spectrum with 7 threatened species. This data indicates a significant variance among countries in terms of their number of threatened endemic birds, which can be influenced by various factors including environmental conditions, habitat destruction, human activities, and conservation efforts.

In 2014, there was a clear disparity in the percentage of adults saving money based on income levels. The highest saving rate was among adults from high-income backgrounds, with approximately 67% reporting they had saved any money in the past year. Middle-income earners were in an intermediate position, with a saving rate of about 54.71%. However, the savings behavior was most conservative among low-income individuals, with less than half, approximately 46.54%, managing to save. Overall, when considering the global average, the data indicates that 56.45% of adults worldwide reported saving money within that year, a figure that sits between the middle and low-income saving rates but lower than the high-income group's rate.

In 2009, the total applied phosphorous to crops from various countries indicates that China led with the highest application at approximately 6.33 million tons. India followed with a substantial amount at 4.15 million tons. The United States also applied a significant volume of phosphorous, totaling around 2.73 million tons. Brazil's use of phosphorous was lower, at approximately 1.38 million tons, demonstrating a notable difference when compared to the top three countries. The other countries listed, such as Pakistan, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, applied considerably lesser amounts, with Pakistan applying around 595,726 tons and South Africa at the lower end, with about 127,327 tons. These figures reflect the variance in agricultural practices and the scale of crop production across these nations, indicating that larger agricultural economies like China and India heavily rely on phosphorous fertilization, which is critical for global food security but also poses environmental concerns.

The provided data details total nitrogen applied to crops in various countries for the year 2009. China leads significantly with approximately 31.32 million tons, showcasing its extensive agricultural input and possibly reflecting its large population's demand for food production. India follows as the second-highest, with 17.48 million tons, another populous nation with a substantial agricultural sector. Notably, the United States applied a substantial amount as well, approximately 13.75 million tons, which may correspond to its large-scale industrial farming practices. The figures for Pakistan and Brazil are relatively similar, both slightly over 3 million tons, indicative of their considerable agricultural activities. France and Canada have lower applications at 2.22 and 1.96 million tons respectively, while Malaysia is on the lower end with roughly 498,522 tons, which might reflect the country's smaller agricultural land usage or different agricultural practices. These figures provide insight into the extent and scale of nitrogen fertilizer application linked to different countries' agricultural systems and food production needs.

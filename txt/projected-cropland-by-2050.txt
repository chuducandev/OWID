The chart illustrates projected changes in global cropland area by 2050 relative to baseline year 2010, with various scenarios influencing the extent of change. Under a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, cropland is expected to expand by 3.35 million square kilometers. However, several interventions can substantially reduce this expansion. Optimizing trade could decrease the required cropland expansion to 3.11 million square kilometers, while adopting healthier diets and closing yield gaps could limit the increases to 1.2 million and 1.1 million square kilometers respectively. Reducing food waste could further mitigate the expansion by 230,000 square kilometers. Impressively, the combined effect of all these interventions could not only offset the BAU expansion but also potentially lead to a net reduction of cropland by 3.39 million square kilometers. This comprehensive approach encompasses improvements in agricultural trade policies, dietary shifts to more plant-based consumption, advancements in agricultural yields, and reductions in food wastage. The data suggest a powerful cumulative impact of multiple sustainable practices on preserving and potentially reducing the need for additional cropland.

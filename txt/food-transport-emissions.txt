The chart presents the breakdown of transport's share in global greenhouse gas emissions from food, with each mode of transportation contributing a different portion to the food system's emissions in 2015. Road transport is the dominant source, responsible for 3.89% of the emissions. This figure is substantially higher compared to the other modes of transport. Shipping and rail, often considered more energy-efficient forms of transportation, have a much smaller impact, contributing only 0.17% and 0.72% respectively. Aviation has the smallest share, at just 0.02%, indicating its minimal role relative to other transportation methods in the context of the food system's emissions. Overall, these numbers reflect the extent to which different transportation modes affect the environmental impact of the global food system.

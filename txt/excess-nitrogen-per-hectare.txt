The chart presents data on excess nitrogen per hectare of cropland for the year 2009 in various countries. Excess nitrogen is a measure of nutrient surplus from farming activities that can potentially lead to environmental issues. China stands out with the highest excess nitrogen value at 150.36 kg per hectare, indicating a significant surplus of nitrogen. Japan follows closely with an excess of 144.73 kg per hectare. On the lower end, Brazil and Sweden show much lower levels of excess nitrogen at 42.1 kg and 43.13 kg per hectare, respectively. Other notable figures include Norway with 125.72 kg per hectare, India with 73.56 kg per hectare, and the United Kingdom and United States with similar values at 61.86 kg and 59.89 kg per hectare, respectively. The substantial variation across these countries reflects differing agricultural practices and their respective impacts on nitrogen levels in cropland ecosystems.

The chart provides a comparison of global food miles by transport method for the year 2010, expressed in million tonne kilometers. The term "food miles" indicates the distance covered to transport food and is represented by the unit of measure known as a tonne-kilometer. Water-based transport dominates the chart, accounting for 5.54 billion tonne kilometers, underscoring its prominence as the primary mode for moving food globally. Road transport follows but with significantly lower figures at 2.91 billion tonne kilometers, indicating its substantial role but not quite matching the scale of water transport. Rail, while less than road, still contributes to a considerable extent, at 930 million tonne kilometers. Air transport, however, has the smallest impact on food transportation among the methods charted, with 15 million tonne kilometers, which is minimal in comparison to the other modes. This data helps illustrate the reliance on different transportation methods for food distribution, with sea and road transport being the most significant contributors to food miles.

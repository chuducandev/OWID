The chart presents the trend in employment numbers within the fisheries and aquaculture sectors worldwide from 1995 to 2018. Over this period, there has been distinct growth in the aquaculture industry, with employment numbers almost tripling from about 7.9 million in 1995 to over 20.5 million in 2018. In contrast, the fisheries sector exhibited a slower rate of increase in employment. From approximately 29.6 million workers in 1995, the sector grew to reach its peak employment at around 39.3 million in 2010, but then saw a slight decline, stabilizing to just under 39 million by 2018.

The growth trend in aquaculture employment is steady and notable, suggesting a significant shift towards fish farming practices over the decades. Meanwhile, the fisheries sector has shown relatively less volatility, with the number of people employed remaining within a narrower band in comparison. The data clearly infers that while traditional fisheries remain a significant source of employment, aquaculture is becoming increasingly relevant within the global landscape of seafood production and employment.

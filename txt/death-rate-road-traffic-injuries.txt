The chart presents the global death rate due to road traffic injuries from the year 2000 to 2019, combining data for both sexes. It highlights a gradual decrease over the two decades. In 2000, the rate was at 19.0 deaths per 100,000 population, which marginally declined to 18.9 by 2005. The downward trend continued more noticeably, reaching 18.1 deaths per 100,000 in 2010. By 2015, the rate had further decreased to 17.0, and in 2019, it stood at 16.7. The consistent reduction in the death rate over the years suggests improvements in road safety, emergency response, or healthcare, leading to fewer fatalities in road traffic incidents on a global scale.

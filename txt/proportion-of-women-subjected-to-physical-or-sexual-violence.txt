The chart presents the proportion of ever-partnered women aged 15-49 who experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner in the previous 12 months, across different countries in various years. Bangladesh reported a notably high rate of 28.8% in 2015, which is significantly higher than the proportions noted in other countries provided in the dataset. Following behind, but still with a substantial percentage, is Malawi with a rate of 24.3% in 2016. In contrast, European countries like Austria and the United Kingdom have reported comparatively lower rates of such violence, with Austria at 4.0% in 2012 and the United Kingdom at 6.0% in the same year. Ghana, in 2008, had a rate of 19.2%, which is lower than that of Bangladesh and Malawi, but significantly higher than that of the European countries mentioned. This data hints at the geographical disparities in the prevalence of intimate partner violence against women and could be indicative of the varying effectiveness of policies, cultural norms, and support systems in place to protect women in these different regions.

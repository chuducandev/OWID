The chart presents the percentage of species within different animal classifications—amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles, and vertebrates—that were traded as products in 2019. A striking insight from the data is the exceptionally high percentage of mammal species involved in trade for products, which stands at 91.4%. This is notably higher than any other group, with birds being the second most traded at 50.3%. Vertebrates as a whole show over half of species being traded at 54.3%. In contrast, reptiles are the least traded according to this metric, with 36.5% of species being involved in product trade. Amphibians are traded slightly more than reptiles at 45.2%, yet still remain relatively lower compared to mammals and birds. This distribution highlights a significant disparity in the wildlife trade, with mammals being disproportionately targeted for products such as meat, medicines, ivory, or other body parts.

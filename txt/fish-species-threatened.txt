In 2018, the chart illustrates the number of fish species classified as threatened in various countries, based on criteria established by the IUCN Red List. The United States far surpasses other listed nations with 251 threatened species, a figure significantly higher than the others. Morocco comes next but with substantially fewer threatened species, amounting to 54. Canada also has a considerable number of threatened fish species, at 44. Lower on the chart, Trinidad and Tobago is home to 37 threatened species, followed by Barbados with 29, and Aruba with 24. Kiribati has the fewest threatened fish species on the list, reporting 14 species classified as endangered, vulnerable, rare, indeterminate, out of danger, or insufficiently known. The data highlights a stark contrast in biodiversity risk between these countries, with the United States in particular facing a challenging situation in terms of fish species conservation.

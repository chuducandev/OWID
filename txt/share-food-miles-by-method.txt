In the year 2010, water-borne transport dominated the food miles share within global food transportation, accounting for 58.97% of the total distance that food was transported. This was significantly higher than the second most prevalent mode, road transport, which constituted 30.97%. Rail transport, while less significant, still contributed a notable share of food transportation at 9.9%. Meanwhile, air freight played a minimal role, contributing only 0.16% to the food miles metric. These food miles are measured in tonne-kilometers, indicating the distance a tonne of goods is carried and highlight the importance of maritime shipping in global food logistics.

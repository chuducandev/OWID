The chart illustrates the number of countries categorized by their historical activity involving biological weapons up to the year 2022. Significantly, the vast majority, 181 countries, have neither pursued nor possessed biological weapons. On the other end of the spectrum, three countries have actually used biological weapons. A small number, six countries, are known to have possessed such weapons. Two countries pursued biological weapons without clear outcomes on their possession or use. Interestingly, there are individual cases where countries were allegedly involved with biological weapons: four countries were allegedly pursuing and one country allegedly possessed them. It is important to note that the term "allegedly" refers to claims not confirmed by the accused country or verified by impartial observers. This chart underscores the limited adoption and use of biological warfare globally but also hints at accusations and pursuits that do not always result in confirmed possession or use.

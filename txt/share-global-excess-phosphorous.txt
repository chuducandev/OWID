The chart presents data on the share of global excess phosphorous from croplands for the year 2009 across various countries. Excess phosphorous is defined as the difference between nutrient inputs (from fertilizers and manure) and the amount harvested in crop material, signifying a loss to the environment that can create ecological imbalances. China is the most significant contributor, with a share of 32.6% of the global excess phosphorous. India follows with 21.8%, highlighting the substantial impact of these two countries compared to others. Brazil and the United States have similar contributions of 6.93% and 6.2%, respectively. Pakistan accounts for 3.03%, while Spain and Portugal have much smaller shares at 1.59% and 0.27%, emphasizing the varying degrees of phosphorous management and potential environmental effects among these nations. The contrast is particularly stark between the top two contributors, China and India, which together constitute over half of the global excess, and smaller economies such as Portugal, with negligible shares in comparison.

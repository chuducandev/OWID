The chart presents data on threatened mammal species in various countries for the year 2018, highlighting the conservation status as critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable, excluding whales and porpoises. Indonesia stands out with the highest number of threatened mammal species at 191, significantly surpassing other countries listed. Madagascar is also notable for a high number at 121. Among the major countries listed, India and Mexico have relatively high numbers, with India at 93 and Mexico at 96 threatened species, respectively. In contrast, countries like Australia, Colombia, and Thailand have fewer threatened species, reporting 63, 58, and 59, respectively. The data from Brazil (80), China (73), and Malaysia (71) indicate moderately high levels of threatened mammal species, reflecting concerns about biodiversity preservation across these nations. These figures underscore the importance of conservation efforts tailored to the specific ecological contexts of these countries to mitigate the risk to these vulnerable mammal populations.

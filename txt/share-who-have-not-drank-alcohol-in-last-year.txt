The chart presents the percentage of adults aged 15 and older who have not consumed alcohol in the past 12 months across a selection of countries for the year 2016. Bangladesh has the highest percentage of non-drinkers with 97.8%, indicating a substantial majority of its adult population abstained from alcohol during that period. Similarly, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have high rates of abstention at 94.2% and 91.2%, respectively. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Germany has the lowest percentage of non-drinkers among the listed countries at 20.6%, followed closely by the United Kingdom and the United States with 26.6% and 28.3%, respectively. These numbers suggest a significant difference in cultural or societal attitudes towards alcohol consumption between these regions, with Western nations reflecting a lower percentage of non-drinking adults. Middle Eastern countries, in contrast, demonstrate larger non-drinking adult populations, potentially due to religious or legal influences that discourage or restrict alcohol consumption. China and India have non-drinking percentages that fall between these two extremes, at 44.1% and 61.2%, respectively, suggesting more moderate levels of abstention compared to the aforementioned nations.

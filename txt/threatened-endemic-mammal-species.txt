Among the nations listed, Madagascar stands out as the country with the highest number of threatened endemic mammals, with a total of 129 species at risk. In contrast, Brazil follows with 59 species, while Australia is home to 54 threatened endemic mammals. The United States and the Democratic Republic of Congo each have significantly fewer threatened species, with 20 and 14 respectively. South Africa matches the Democratic Republic of Congo with 14 endangered endemic species. Jamaica is the only country among those listed where there are no reported threatened endemic mammals. The data originates from the IUCN Red List (2020) and highlights the varying degrees of biodiversity risk across different geographical locations, with a particularly notable concentration of endangered species on the island nation of Madagascar.

The chart presents data on the share of CO2 emissions from tropical deforestation and peatlands for the year 2013, across various agricultural sectors. The most significant contributor to these emissions is cattle farming, accounting for 34.1%, which is a significant margin higher than any other category. The next largest contributor is oilseeds, with a share of 21.6%, followed by forestry logging at 12%. Other notable sectors include other cereals excluding rice and wheat, and vegetables, fruit, & nuts which both contribute approximately 8.9% and 8.8%, respectively. Paddy rice is associated with 7.3% of the emissions, while other crops account for 4.8%. Sugar cane/beet and wheat have relatively minor shares at 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively, and the smallest share comes from plant-based fibers at just 0.4%. The data underscores the dominance of cattle and oilseed production in contributing to emissions from deforestation and peatlands, signaling that these areas may be critical targets for emission reduction strategies.

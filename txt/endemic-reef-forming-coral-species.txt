The chart presents the number of endemic reef-forming coral species per country for the year 2020. Endemic species are unique to a specific geographic area and don't naturally occur elsewhere. The United States leads with a total of 9 endemic coral species. Brazil follows with 7 species, illustrating a significant diversity of corals specific to its waters. Australia is home to 5 endemic coral species, positioning it in the middle of the range amongst these countries. Madagascar has a lower count of 3 species, while both Ecuador and Sri Lanka have the least, with only 1 endemic species each. The distribution of these endemic corals indicates unique biodiversity in each country, reflecting the impact of long-term geographical isolation and the development of species that are adapted to specific local conditions.

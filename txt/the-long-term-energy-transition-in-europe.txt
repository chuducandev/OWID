The chart illustrates the evolution of energy sources in Italy from 1900 to 1950. Fossil fuels experienced a notable growth, climbing from 26% of Italy's energy mix in 1900 to 47% by 1950, highlighting the country's increasing reliance on coal, oil, and gas during this period. Meanwhile, the dependency on firewood significantly declined, dropping from 34% to 17%. Interestingly, the use of muscle power, such as human and animal labor, remained the largest energy source in 1900 at 39%, but by 1950 it had decreased to 27%, reflecting a shift towards mechanization. Primary electricity showed a remarkable increase, starting from a meager 0.1% in 1900 and expanding to 9% by 1950, indicating the advent of electrification. Wind and water power remained relatively stable yet minor components of the energy profile, moving from 1% in 1900 and then disappearing from the record by 1950, possibly due to the rise of more reliable and potent energy sources. This transition charts a pivotal shift in Italy's energy landscape, underlining a decrease in reliance on traditional energy carriers and a move towards more industrial energy sources.

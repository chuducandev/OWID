The chart shows nitrogen application per hectare of cropland in different countries for the year 2009. China leads by a significant margin, applying 191.69 kg of nitrogen per hectare, which is substantially higher than other countries. France follows with 124.20 kg of nitrogen per hectare, positioning itself in the mid-high range. The United States and India are relatively close in their nitrogen application rates at 103.62 kg and 95.37 kg per hectare, respectively. Countries like Malaysia and South Africa have moderate nitrogen application rates, with Malaysia at 86.95 kg and South Africa at 73.32 kg per hectare. Brazil's application rate is relatively lower at 60.90 kg per hectare. Malawi has the lowest nitrogen application rate among the listed countries, with only 29.04 kg of nitrogen applied per hectare, indicating a large disparity compared to China's application rate. The data reflect varied agricultural practices and the potential intensity of fertilizer use across these countries.

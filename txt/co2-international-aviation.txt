This chart presents data on CO2 emissions from international aviation in 2018, with emissions attributed to the country of departure for each flight. In that year, the United States led in emissions with significantly higher CO2 contribution, at approximately 55.8 million metric tons (Mt). China followed with around 30.37 million Mt, making it the second-largest contributor. The United Kingdom also had substantial emissions, with about 28.34 million Mt. Spain and Australia show emissions higher than 10 million Mt but less than half of China's, with Spain at roughly 15.65 million Mt and Australia at approximately 12.35 million Mt. Canada and India, on the other hand, had lower emissions relative to the other countries listed, with Canada emitting near 10.92 million Mt and India at close to 8.59 million Mt. This data reflects the significant variance in international aviation CO2 emissions among countries, indicating the importance of these regions in contributing to global aviation-related carbon footprints.

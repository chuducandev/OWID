The chart presents the average discard rates of various fishing gears in 2014, illustrating the percentage of the total catch that is thrown back into the sea after being caught. The data reflect a significant variation in discard rates across different fishing methods. Shrimp trawl stands out with the highest discard rate at 54.9%, which is significantly higher than the rest. This is followed by the Otter twin trawl gear with a discard rate of 43.5%. On the lower end of the spectrum, purse seine exhibits the lowest discard rate at 4.7%, making it the most efficient method in terms of reducing unwanted catch. Other low-impact methods include pole-and-line and handline, with discard rates of 9.4% and 9.5% respectively. Gillnets used along the bottom tend to have a higher discard rate of 26.1%, when compared to gillnets used in pelagic, midwater areas, which have a considerably lower rate of 11.7%. Bottom longlines also show a high discard rate at 23.9%. The data suggest a clear disparity in discard rates with some methods such as shrimp trawls and otter twin trawls being much more likely to result in higher levels of discarded catch

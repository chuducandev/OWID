The chart details the male-to-female ratio of high school students enrolled in chemistry, mathematics, and science courses in the United States from 1957 to 2000. In 1957, the ratio for chemistry was 1.32, for mathematics, it was 1.39, and for science, it was 1.3, indicating more males than females were taking these subjects. Over the decades, the ratios declined, suggesting an approach toward gender parity in enrollment. Notably, by the year 2000, chemistry enrollment had the most significant decrease to 0.89, falling below parity, while mathematics and science were closely tied at 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. The year 1972 shows a gap in the data for chemistry but indicates that mathematics and science were at 1.26 and 1.22, respectively. This trend demonstrates a consistent narrowing of the gender enrollment gap across all three subjects, with the convergence towards parity being most pronounced in chemistry by the end of the observed period.

In 2017, a striking total of 349.8 million people across the world could not afford a calorie-sufficient diet, which is deemed unaffordable if it costs more than 52% of a household's income. Nigeria was at the forefront of this crisis with an overwhelming 85.8 million of its population unable to meet their dietary energy requirements through the lowest-cost starchy staple food. Following Nigeria, India was also facing a severe challenge with 43.4 million people lacking the monetary means to afford sufficient calories. Compared to these figures, China's number stood at a lower but still significant count of 2.9 million individuals. Brazil and Niger, though dealing with the same issue, showed comparatively fewer cases, having 7.3 and 3 million people respectively unable to afford an energy-sufficient diet. This data highlights a pressing issue of food affordability that is affecting a substantial number of people, with Nigeria and India together accounting for more than a third of the global total.

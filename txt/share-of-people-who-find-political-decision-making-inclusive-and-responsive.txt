The chart presents data on the proportion of the population who believe that decision-making in their country is inclusive and responsive. The figures reflect the percentage of individuals who feel that they have a say in political decision-making within their respective countries. Among the listed nations for the most recent reporting years, Colombia leads with a relatively higher percentage of 37% in 2022, indicating that more than a third of its population feels included in the political process. Palestine follows with 33.5% in the same year, suggesting that about a third of its residents believe they can influence political decisions. In stark contrast, Tunisia stands out with a significantly lower proportion, where only 9.7% of the population shares this belief as of 2021, implying a widespread sentiment of exclusion from political decision-making among Tunisians. This data illustrates the varying degrees of perceived political inclusivity and responsiveness in different socio-political contexts.

The chart provides a comparison of the number of trees in seven different countries for the year 2014. It is clear that Russia leads the count with a staggering 642 billion trees. Brazil, with an impressive 302 billion trees, holds the second spot, followed by the United States, which has 228 billion trees. China's tree population is significant as well, with 140 billion trees. Indonesia and India have a comparatively smaller number of trees, with 80.67 billion and 35.18 billion trees respectively. Botswana has the fewest trees among the listed countries, with just over 8 billion trees. The stark difference between the tree populations in these countries is highlighted, with the top two countries, Russia and Brazil, having a combined total of nearly a trillion trees, which emphasizes the vast natural tree resources they possess.

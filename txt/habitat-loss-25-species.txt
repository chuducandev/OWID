The chart presents a forecast for the number of species at risk of losing more than 25% of their habitat by the year 2050 in various countries, as a consequence of agricultural expansion. Kenya tops the chart with a staggering 422 species predicted to be at risk. The Democratic Republic of Congo follows with 331 species under threat, highlighting a significant concern for biodiversity in the African continent. Nigeria is third, anticipating a risk to 293 species. Comparatively, India and Madagascar show a lower number of species at risk, with 52 and 43 respectively. The data underscores a concerning trend among these nations, where agricultural practices could severely impact their native species, suggesting the need for proactive conservation efforts to mitigate potential habitat losses.

The chart presents the share of tropical deforestation attributed to commodity production in various regions for the year 2013. Brazil leads with a significant margin at 33.12%, reflecting its major contribution to deforestation driven by activities such as agriculture and cattle ranching. The Americas, excluding Brazil and Mexico, come next with 20.85%, highlighting that even without Brazil, the larger American continent remains a substantial contributor to this issue. Africa follows with a share of 17.46%, which is notable but less than the Americas excluding Brazil. Indonesia's deforestation share stands at 13.94%, pointing towards the substantial impact of its commodity production on tropical forests. Asia and the Pacific, excluding Indonesia and India, have a lower share at 11.21%, suggesting a relatively smaller yet significant contribution to tropical deforestation from those regions. Meanwhile, Mexico and India have the smallest shares, at 2.01% and 1.41% respectively, indicating their much lesser role in deforestation for commodities compared to the other regions and countries listed.

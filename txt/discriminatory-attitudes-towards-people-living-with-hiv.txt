The chart illustrates the percentage of people with discriminatory attitudes towards individuals living with HIV as of 2019, using the specific metric of respondents' willingness to buy fresh vegetables from a shopkeeper or vendor if they knew the person was HIV-positive. Algeria exhibits the highest level of discriminatory attitude among the surveyed entities with over half of the population (54.1%) responding "No" to the question. In comparison, the Central African Republic demonstrates a lower level of such attitudes, with 35.1% of respondents expressing they would not purchase from someone known to be living with HIV. It's important to note that Togo's data is slightly outdated (2014 and 2017), showing a marginal increase in discriminatory attitudes from 45.8% to 46.7%. Sudan's data, even more dated from 2010, indicates a notably higher discriminatory sentiment with 65.9% of respondents against buying from an HIV-positive individual. These figures are particularly based on responses from individuals who have previously heard of HIV, implying a need for continued education and awareness programs to combat stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS.

The efficiency of lighting in the United Kingdom has seen a dramatic increase over three centuries, according to the data provided. From 1700 to 1750, the efficiency of lighting made only modest gains, increasing from 27.92 to 28.6 lumen-hours per kilowatt-hour of energy. However, by 1800, there was a noticeable improvement to 38.9, hinting at the beginnings of technological advancements.

The 19th century marked a period of significant progress. By 1850, lighting efficiency had undergone a remarkable five-fold increase from the turn of the century, achieving 161.8 lumen-hours. This surge continued exponentially through the 1900s, reaching 470.64 lumen-hours.

What followed in the 20th century was an unprecedented leap in lighting technology. The data for 1950 records an astounding value of 11,552.27 lumen-hours, indicating a period of rapid growth and innovation. This trend persisted into the new millennium, with year 2000 data reflecting an efficiency of 25,000 lumen-hours, emblematic of advanced lighting technologies becoming widespread, such as fluorescent and LED lighting. This chart encapsulates a journey from relatively static efficiency levels to a steep ascend,

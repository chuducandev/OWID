The chart presents the distribution of global food loss and waste by region for the year 2009, as per data from the World Resources Institute. The region of Industrialized Asia was the most significant contributor to food loss and waste, accounting for 28% of the global share. South and Southeast Asia followed with 23%. North America and Oceania, along with Europe, each contributed 14%, representing moderate shares. Sub-Saharan Africa was responsible for 9%, while North Africa, West, and Central Asia had a slightly lower share at 7%. Latin America contributed the least to food loss and waste, with only 6% in the global context. This data indicates a higher propensity for food loss and waste in Asia, particularly in industrialized and southeastern parts. In contrast, Latin American, African, and West Asian regions had lower shares, suggesting regional differences in food supply chain management and consumer waste practices.

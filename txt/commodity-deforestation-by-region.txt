The provided chart illustrates annual forest loss measured in hectares across different regions for the year 2013. Brazil experienced the highest forest loss at about 1.71 million hectares, a significant figure that underscores the country's challenge with deforestation. The Americas, excluding Brazil and Mexico, also saw substantial forest loss amounting to approximately 1.08 million hectares. Africa follows with over 902,000 hectares of forest loss, depicting a considerable environmental concern for the continent.

Indonesia reported a sizeable forest loss as well, at approximately 720,694 hectares, placing it fourth on the list. The combined regions of Asia and the Pacific, excluding Indonesia and India, lost about 579,360 hectares, reflecting a significant impact on the region's forest resources.

At the lower end of the scale, Mexico recorded a forest loss of just over 103,957 hectares, and India had the least reported forest loss, with 73,018 hectares. These lower figures, especially in the case of India, suggest a smaller scale of deforestation relative to the other listed regions. The aggregate forest loss for the tropical region in 2013 stands at a notable 5.17 million hectares, indicating a major challenge to tropical forest conservation.

The chart illustrates the annual net change in forest area for Brazil over a span of 25 years from 1990 to 2015. It's a clear representation of deforestation levels, with all recorded changes being negative, indicating a consistent loss of forest area annually. In 1990, the net change in forest area was approximately -3.78 million hectares. A decade later, this increased slightly to roughly -3.95 million hectares in 2000, reflecting an increase in the rate of forest loss. However, the subsequent decade showed a significant improvement when the annual deforestation rate dropped almost by half to about -1.54 million hectares by 2010. By 2015, a slight reduction was further observed, with the forest area change being approximately -1.45 million hectares. From this data, one can infer a worrying trend of forest area loss in the initial years, but also recognize the considerable deceleration in the rate of forest loss in the latter years, suggesting that measures taken to reduce deforestation might have had some impact.

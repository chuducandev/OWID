In 2016, the alcohol-attributable fraction (AAF) for all-cause deaths varied significantly among a selection of countries. Russia had the highest AAF at 21.6%, indicating a substantial impact of alcohol on mortality. Both Peru and Brazil displayed an AAF of 6.9%, which, while sizeable, was significantly lower than Russia's figure. France's AAF stood at 5.8%, closely followed by the United States at 4.9% and the United Kingdom at 4.6%. On the lower end, Fiji showed a 1.7% AAF associated with alcohol consumption, and Bangladesh had the lowest recorded AAF at a mere 0.9%. These figures underscore the varying degrees to which alcohol consumption contributes to health outcomes across different national contexts. The stark contrast between Russia and other countries, especially Bangladesh, highlights substantial differences in the health burden attributed to alcohol across these nations.

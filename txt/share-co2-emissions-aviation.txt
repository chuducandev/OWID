In 2018, the United States was responsible for the largest share of global CO2 emissions from aviation, contributing a significant 24.36% to the total. Following far behind, China accounted for 12.71% of the emissions, making it the second largest contributor. Other notable emitters included the United Kingdom at 3.99% and India at 2.59%, with Australia closely trailing at 2.54%. Canada was also a contributor but to a lesser extent at 2.30%. In comparison, Norway's share was relatively minimal at just 0.36%, displaying a stark contrast to the higher emissions of larger or more industrialized nations. This data underscores the heavy impact of some of the world's largest economies on the aviation sector's carbon footprint.

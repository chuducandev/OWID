The chart presents the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) among five-year-old children in Chad, Mali, and South Sudan from 2015 to 2020. South Sudan started with the highest prevalence at 21.13% in 2015 but showed a substantial drop to 10.08% by 2018, before a rise to 13.03% in 2020. Chad's prevalence increased significantly from 3.08% in 2015 to a peak of 12.6% in 2018, before declining slightly to 10.79% in 2020. Mali's prevalence remained relatively stable and lower compared to the other two countries, starting at 4.88% in 2015, decreasing marginally to 4.55% in 2018, and showing a small increase to 4.62% in 2020. The variations in prevalence indicate differing trends and intervention effectiveness across these countries within the five-year span.

The chart provides a breakdown of the share of different species traded in 2019, indicating the extent to which various animal groups are involved in global trade. Birds constitute the largest share with nearly half of the species at 44.5% being traded, revealing a significant level of commercial interest in avian species, potentially for pets or products. Mammals also form a notable proportion with 22.8% traded, showcasing their prominence in trade, possibly for their meat, fur, or as exotic pets. Reptiles are traded to a lesser extent at 13.4%, while amphibians have the smallest share at only 8.4%, suggesting these species are less frequently traded compared to birds and mammals. Overall, vertebrates account for a substantial 24.1% of species traded, indicating that a considerable fraction of species with backbones are subjected to trade. These figures highlight the scale and diversity of wildlife trade across different taxonomic groups, raising potential concerns for conservation and biodiversity.

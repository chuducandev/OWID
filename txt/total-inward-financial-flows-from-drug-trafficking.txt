The chart illustrates the total value of inward illicit financial flows associated with drug trafficking for Mexico and Peru between the years 2015 and 2018. In this context, Mexico consistently reported higher values throughout the period compared to Peru, with Mexico's illicit financial inflows peaking in 2016 at approximately $12.76 billion. Although Mexico saw a marginal decrease in 2017 to about $12.36 billion, by 2018, there was a notable decline to approximately $10.95 billion, indicating a reduction in the total value of these flows within that year. Conversely, Peru demonstrated a gradually increasing trend with the total inward illicit financial flows rising from $1.34 billion in 2015, to approximately $1.45 billion in 2016, and further increasing to around $1.66 billion in 2017. These trends reflect the differing scales and possible shifts in drug trafficking activities within these two countries over the observed years.

The provided chart illustrates the global coal reserves in 2020, broken down by coal type, with Anthracite and Bituminous coal reserves totaling 753.64 billion tonnes, and Sub-bituminous and Lignite coal reserves at 320.47 billion tonnes. Notably, the chart categorizes coal types based on carbon content, which is indicative of the quality and environmental impact of the coal when burned. Anthracite and Bituminous, being of higher quality, are shown to constitute more than twice the quantity of reserves compared to the lower quality coals, Sub-bituminous and Lignite. This higher-quality coal is valued for producing fewer local air pollutants upon combustion, highlighting the relevance of such reserves in global energy discussions.

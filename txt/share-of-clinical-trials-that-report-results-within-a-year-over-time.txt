The chart illustrates an increasing trend in the proportion of clinical trials in the European Economic Area (EEA) that report their results to the European Clinical Trials Register (EU-CTR) within one year of completion. The data covers a span from 2018 to 2021. In 2018, less than half of the clinical trials, at 49.6%, met the reporting deadline. However, there was a consistent year-on-year improvement. By 2019, the proportion reporting on time had slightly increased to 52.8%. The year 2020 saw a more substantial rise to 63.2%. The following year, 2021, showed the highest proportion, with 68.8% of clinical trials reporting results on time, which is a significant improvement from the initial figure in 2018. This positive trajectory indicates an enhanced compliance with reporting requirements over the years among sponsors of clinical trials in the EEA.

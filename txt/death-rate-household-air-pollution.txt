The chart illustrates the age-standardized mortality rate attributed to household air pollution for the year 2019 across different entities. Sierra Leone registers the highest mortality rate with 188 deaths per 100,000 population, indicating a significant health impact from household air pollution in this country. Nepal follows with a considerable rate of 131 deaths per 100,000 population, showing that it too faces a serious challenge with air quality inside homes. China's statistic stands at 40 deaths per 100,000, markedly lower than that of Sierra Leone and Nepal but nonetheless reflective of household air pollution being a concern. In stark contrast, Barbados shows a rate of zero, suggesting either an absence of or highly effective measures to prevent deaths due to household air pollution, setting a notable standard in this context. The data is age-standardized to ensure comparability across different countries with varying population age structures, offering a clear perspective on the impact of household air quality on health outcomes.

In 2015, investment in renewable energy as a percentage of GDP varied considerably among different nations. South Africa and Chile led the pack, each dedicating 1.4% of their GDP to renewable investment, positioning themselves as the most invested among the countries listed. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the United States allocated the least, with renewable investment comprising just 0.2% of its GDP. Close to the U.S., Germany and Mexico also exhibited modest investment levels, at 0.3% of GDP each. Economic giants like China and the United Kingdom took a moderate approach, investing 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively, while Japan matched the UK's investment percentage. Meanwhile, investment figures for emerging economies like India and Brazil stood at 0.5% and 0.4%, reflecting a moderate but growing commitment to renewable energy funding relative to their economic output. Overall, the data reveals a mixed approach to renewable investment relative to national GDPs, with developing nations like South Africa and Chile showing relatively high investment rates, while some developed countries like the United States and Germany seem more conservative in their renewable energy funding relative to their larger economies.

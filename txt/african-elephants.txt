The African elephant population has experienced a dramatic decline over the past several centuries. In 1500, the population was estimated at 26 million, but by 1913 this figure had dropped significantly to 10 million, marking a major decrease over several centuries. More recent history shows an even sharper decline: by 1979, the number had plummeted to just 1.3 million. While there was a brief period of recovery with increments of population noted in the late 1990s and early 2000s, reaching around 402,047 elephants in 2002 and peaking at 472,269 in 2007, the population again decreased to 426,293 by 2013. Although the decline seems to have somewhat stabilized, the number of African elephants still remains alarmingly low, with an estimated 415,428 elephants recorded in 2015. The data provides a stark indication of the severe impact that historical factors, likely including poaching and habitat loss, have had on Africa's elephant populations.

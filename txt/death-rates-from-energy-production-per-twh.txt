The chart illustrates the mortality rates associated with various energy sources per terawatt-hour of electricity produced, using data from 2021. It is evident from the chart that brown coal is the most lethal energy source with a significant death rate of 32.72 deaths per terawatt-hour. It is closely followed by coal at 24.62 deaths per TWh, suggesting that fossil fuels pose substantial health risks. Oil production also shows a high mortality rate with 18.43 deaths per TWh. In contrast, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar exhibit the lowest mortality rates at 0.04 and 0.02 deaths per TWh, respectively, which underscores their safety and sustainability compared to fossil fuels. Nuclear power, often debated for its safety, has an exceptionally low death rate of 0.03 deaths per TWh, revealing that despite public concern, it is among the safest forms of energy production in terms of death rates. Biomass and gas are intermediate, with death rates of 4.63 and 2.82 per TWh, respectively, while hydropower's rate stands at 1.3 deaths per TWh. The data highlights the variability in mortality risks across different energy production methods and reinforces the relative safety of renewable and

The chart presents data on the availability of dedicated heart failure (HF) centers within hospitals per million people in selected countries, predominantly for the year 2018. Italy and Norway stand out with notably higher rates of such specialized centers, registering 7.4 and 7.5 per million people, respectively. Italy's data is from 2017, while Norway's is slightly earlier from 2016. Germany and Switzerland have moderate levels of HF center availabilityâ€”both just above 1 per million, with 1.3 for Germany in 2018 and 1.2 for Switzerland in 2017. Belarus, on the lower end, has 0.8 HF centers per million people for the year 2018. Strikingly, Russia has no dedicated heart failure centers per million people, according to the data from 2018. This chart underscores the significant disparities in the provision of specialized cardiac care among these European nations.

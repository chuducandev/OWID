In 2013, cattle ranching accounted for the largest share of commodity-driven deforestation at 40.7%, indicating its substantial impact on tropical forests. Following cattle, the cultivation of oilseeds contributed 18.4% to deforestation, while forestry logging was responsible for 13.1%. Other significant contributors included other cereals excluding rice and wheat at 8.6%, and vegetables, fruit, and nuts at 7.3%. Meanwhile, paddy rice, other crops, sugar cane/beet, wheat, and plant-based fibers had relatively smaller shares, with paddy rice at 5.6%, other crops at 3.6%, sugar cane/beet at 1.1%, and both wheat and plant-based fibers at 1.0% and 0.5% respectively. This data highlights the need for sustainable practices in cattle and oilseed production, as well as in forestry activities, to reduce the environmental impacts of deforestation associated with agriculture and logging.

The chart presents tree density data, measured in trees per capita, for several countries as of 2014. New Zealand stands out with the highest tree density, boasting an impressive 2,543 trees per person. Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo also show significant tree coverages with 1,494 and 1,461 trees per capita respectively, reflecting their large forested areas. Colombia follows after with a considerable density of 1,051 trees per capita. The United States has a moderate figure of 716, while Malaysia's count is lower, at 501 trees per capita. In contrast, Uruguay and the United Kingdom exhibit much lower tree densities, with Uruguay at 159 and the United Kingdom at 47 trees per person, indicating a much sparser distribution of trees relative to their populations. These figures highlight the varied levels of natural tree abundance across countries, potentially influencing each nation's environmental policies, conservation efforts, and impacts on climate change due to varying levels of carbon sequestration by trees.

The chart presents data on the number of wasted children in China from 1987 to 2017. Wasted children are defined as those under five years old whose weight is significantly lower than the average for their height, often due to acute food shortage or disease. The chart shows a substantial decline in the number of wasted children over the three decades. In 1987, there were approximately 5.55 million wasted children, but by 1990, this number decreased slightly to around 5.35 million. A more notable reduction occurred by 1998, with the number dropping to approximately 2.13 million. The decline continued, though at a slower pace, and by 2010, the number was roughly 1.97 million. There was a slight increase in 2009 and 2017, with the figures at just over 2.19 million and 1.72 million, respectively, but these numbers did not reach the earlier peak levels. The downward trend suggests improvements in child nutrition and health in China over the observed years.

The chart illustrates the proportions of global production for several key agricultural products contributed by Ukraine and Russia in 2019. Ukraine is a significant producer of sunflower oil, leading the global production with 29.53%, closely followed by Russia at 26.96%. Together, they contribute more than half of the world's supply. In barley production, Russia's share is more than double that of Ukraine, accounting for 12.89% compared to Ukraine's 5.61%. Wheat production sees Russia contributing 9.72%, with Ukraine accounting for 3.7%. Lastly, for maize (corn), Ukraine has a relatively minor share of global production at 3.12%, with Russia's share even smaller at 1.24%. The considerable contributions of both countries to global crop supplies, especially in the case of sunflower oil, underscore their significance in the global agricultural landscape.

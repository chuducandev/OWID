The chart presents the number of hospitals with catheterization labs (cath labs) per million people for various countries at different points in time up to 2021. Greece leads with the highest availability, showcasing 5.41 cath labs per million people as of 2020. Italy and Finland follow closely with 4.46 and 4.35 cath labs per million people respectively, both measured in 2019. On the lower end of the spectrum, Norway has the fewest with just 1.68 cath labs per million in 2019, notably less than other countries listed. Countries like Ireland, Spain, and the United Kingdom exhibit a moderate availability, ranging from 2.55 to 2.66 cath labs per million people. The data suggests a considerable variation in the availability of these specialized facilities across European nations and nearby countries, which can be critical in diagnosing and treating cardiovascular conditions. Notably, the data should be interpreted with caution due to the different years of reporting, with the most recent data from Sweden in 2021 showing 2.63 cath labs per million people.

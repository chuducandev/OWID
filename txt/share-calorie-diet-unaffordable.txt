In 2017, there was a significant variation in the share of the population across different countries who could not afford a calorically sufficient diet. Rwanda had the highest percentage, with 28.1% of its population unable to afford the calories they need, which stands out as a stark contrast to the situation in Canada and Malaysia, where 0% of the population faced this issue. The global average stood at 4.9%, indicating that worldwide, a noticeable fraction of the population experienced food affordability issues. Meanwhile, Indonesia and India showed higher than average percentages, at 4.3% and 3.2%, respectively, which suggests substantial challenges in ensuring affordable diets for all. More developed nations such as Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States had a negligible share of their populations unable to afford sufficient calories, each with 0.2%, 0.2%, and 1.2%, respectively. The data highlights significant disparities in food affordability, which aligns with the varying levels of economic development and income distribution among these nations.

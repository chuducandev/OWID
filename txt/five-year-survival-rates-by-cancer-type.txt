The provided data details the progression of five-year survival rates for various types of cancer in the United Kingdom from 1999 to 2009. The most notable improvement within this period is observed in prostate cancer survival rates, which increased from 68.4% in 1999 to 83.2% in 2009. Breast cancer also saw a notable rise in survival rates, from 74.2% in 1999 to 81.1% in 2009. There were smaller yet consistent increases across other cancers, such as cervix (from 58.0% to 60.2%), colon (48.1% to 53.8%), and leukaemia (42.0% to 47.0%). Conversely, the survival rates for liver and lung cancers remained low, with only a modest increase in liver cancer from 6.7% to 9.3% and lung cancer from 7.3% to 9.6%. The overall trend suggests a significant improvement in the prognosis and management of certain cancers over the decade, with prostate and breast cancer showing the highest survival improvements.

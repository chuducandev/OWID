The chart illustrates China's annual afforestation efforts, measured in hectares, over several years from 1990 to 2015. Afforestation, which involves establishing forests on land that was not previously classified as forest, saw an increase in China from approximately 1.19 million hectares in 1990 to its peak at approximately 1.57 million hectares in 2000. However, after 2000, the afforestation rates began a gradual decline, first to around 1.22 million hectares by 2010, and further to approximately 1.07 million hectares by 2015. Despite this decline, the levels of afforestation have consistently remained above 1 million hectares throughout the years reported. This reflects an ongoing commitment to forest establishment, although the decreasing trend in later years indicates a reduction in the scale of these afforestation activities.

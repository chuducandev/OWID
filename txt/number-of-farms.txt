The chart presents data on the number of farms in various countries, with figures based on the latest available agricultural census unique to each country. It reveals a striking disparity in the number of farms across these nations. China leads with a staggering 193.45 million farms as per the 1997 census, followed by India, which had nearly 119.89 million farms in 2001. In clear contrast, Ethiopia had 10.76 million farms in 2002, while Brazil reported 4.84 million farms in 1996.

The United States is shown to have had about 2.13 million farms in 2002, which, although significant, is much less when compared to the leading Asian countries. Down the scale, Malawi had 1.56 million farms as of 1993, and the United Kingdom had a modest 233,250 farms in 2000, demonstrating the vast differences in agricultural landscapes and possibly the scale of agricultural operations between these regions. The disparity suggests diverse agricultural practices, land use, and possibly varied levels of agrarian economies among the countries represented.

The chart data presents the percentage of male and female children aged 7-14 in employment in Nepal from 1999 to 2014. In 1999, a significant proportion of children were engaged in employment, with females exceeding males at 52.4% compared to 42.2%. By 2008, there was noticeable progress in reducing child employment, with the percentage dropping to 36.2% for males and 45.4% for females. However, in 2014, while the percentage of female children in employment continued to decline to 44.1%, the percentage of male children increased again, reaching 41.5%. The overall trend indicates a decrease in child employment for females over the 15 years, whereas for males, the early reduction was reversed by 2014. Despite the positive reduction for females, the percentage of children in employment remained high, suggesting that Nepalâ€™s challenge with child employment persisted, particularly amongst female children who consistently exhibited higher rates of employment than their male counterparts throughout this period.

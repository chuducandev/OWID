The chart presents data on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from aviation in 2018, for a selection of countries. The United States stands out with the highest emissions, generating approximately 181.91 million tons of CO2, which is significantly more than any other country listed. China follows with 94.91 million tons, marking it as the second largest contributor among the presented nations. There is then a notable drop in emissions to the United Kingdom, which produced 29.85 million tons, making it the third-largest contributor on the list.

From this data, it is evident there's a substantial gap between the top two emitters, the United States and China, and the other countries. The total emissions of the United States are almost double those of China, and more than six times those of the United Kingdom. Other countries listed, such as Germany, India, and Australia, also contribute sizeable amounts, with emissions ranging from around 19 to 22 million tons. Canada and Brazil have the lowest figures among the listed countries, with emissions totaling approximately 17.16 and 14.81 million tons respectively. This data underscores the significant variation in aviation-related CO2 emissions across different countries, with a clear concentration in the United States.

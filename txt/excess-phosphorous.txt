The chart illustrates the total excess phosphorous from croplands in 2009 for selected countries, with excess phosphorous defined as the difference between nutrient inputs and the amount harvested in crops, which can lead to environmental imbalances. China far exceeds all other listed countries, with a total of approximately 4.62 million tons of excess phosphorous. India follows, with a significant amount as well, roughly 3.09 million tons. The United States also contributes noticeably to excess phosphorous, albeit at a much lower magnitude than China and India, with about 879,438 tons. Other countries listed — Mexico, South Africa, France, and the United Kingdom — have considerably lower totals, all below 300,000 tons. Mexico's excess phosphorous stands at 282,872 tons, South Africa at 71,498 tons, France at 53,186 tons, and the United Kingdom at the bottom with 30,088 tons. The drastic difference between the top two contributors and the others highlights a considerable imbalance in phosphorous management among these nations.

The provided chart details a declining trend in the global incidence of child labor among children aged 10-14 from 1950 to 1995. In 1950, the child labor participation rate was 27.57%, which demonstrated a gradual descent over each subsequent decade. By 1960, this figure decreased to 24.81%, showing a reduction yet still indicating that about one in every four children was participating in the labor force. The downward trajectory continued, with the rate dropping to 22.3% in 1970 and further to 19.91% in 1980, suggesting progressive improvements over time. The most marked decline occurred between 1980 and 1990, with the rate plummeting to 14.65%. By 1995, the incidence of child labor fell to 13.02%, roughly halving from the rate at the mid-twentieth century. The data implicitly highlights the effectiveness of measures taken internationally to combat child labor over the noted period, leading to a more than 50% decrease in child labor participation rates within 45 years.

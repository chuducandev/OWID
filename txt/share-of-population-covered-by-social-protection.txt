The data presents the coverage of social protection and labor programs as a percentage of the population in Brazil over several years, with a single data point provided for Syria. In Brazil, the coverage experienced fluctuations. It began at 53.93% in 2006, dipped to a low of 45.34% by 2011, then climbed back to a similar peak of 53.81% in 2015. However, after 2015, the coverage slightly declined and showed stabilization around the 50% mark, with the latest figure at 50.31% in 2019. Syria, on the other hand, has a single observation showing a significantly lower coverage of only 8.19% in 2003. This contrast starkly illustrates Brazil's broader implementation of social protection and labor programs compared to the available data for Syria, albeit with Brazil experiencing some variability over the observed years. The data suggest that half of Brazil's population has been covered by such programs in recent years, indicating a sustained effort to provide social insurance, safety nets, and unemployment benefits, though not reaching the levels seen at the beginning and in the middle of the observed period.

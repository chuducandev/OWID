The chart displays the COVID-19 monthly death rate by vaccination status in England for all age groups, with data from January 15, 2021, to October 15, 2021. Initially, only the death rate for unvaccinated individuals is shown, starting at a high of 98.6 deaths per 100,000 people on January 15, which then peaks at 158.9 on February 15 before declining significantly to 3.7 by May 15. A notable increase to 17.2 is observed by July 15, followed by another climb to 31.4 by August 15, and then a gradual decrease to 23.8 by October 15.

The data for fully vaccinated individuals begins from February 15, starting at a very low 1.3 deaths per 100,000, increasing marginally over the following months to reach 5.2 by October 15. Throughout the entire period, the death rate among unvaccinated individuals remains substantially higher than that of the fully vaccinated. A marked reduction in the death rate for the unvaccinated can be seen after the initial months, highlighting a strong contrast between the two groups and underscoring the impact of vaccination on COVID-19

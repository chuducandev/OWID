In 2017, the global issue of food affordability was highlighted by the staggering number of individuals unable to afford a nutrient adequate diet. Approximately 2.28 billion people worldwide faced this challenge. India represented the largest affected population, with an alarming figure of 866.2 million people unable to afford such a diet. Though far behind India, China and Nigeria also had significant populations in this predicament, with 135.5 million and 134.3 million, respectively. Brazil accounted for 37.8 million people, a figure smaller in comparison but still reflecting a significant societal issue. Niger and Rwanda, though smaller in population size, also saw substantial numbers with 16.8 million and 7.5 million individuals affected, indicating that the affordability of a nutrient-sufficient diet is a pervasive problem across various regions and economies.

The data showcases the changes in mangrove area in Benin from 2007 to 2020, as a percentage relative to the baseline extent of mangroves in 2000. What we can observe from the provided figures is a concerning decline in the mangrove area during earlier years, reaching a peak decrease of 21.53% in 2008. Following this period, the decline rate slowed down, showing a gradual progression towards stability. Notable years of positive changes were 2016 and 2017, with an increase of 1.69% and 1.31%, respectively. However, by 2020, there was a slight negative change again of -1.19%, indicating that mangrove recovery is not yet secure and consistency in positive growth is not maintained. The fluctuations over the years underscore the varying effectiveness of conservation efforts and the impact of external pressures on mangrove ecosystems in Benin. The risk of mangrove decline is still present, signaling the need for continuous environmental protection strategies.

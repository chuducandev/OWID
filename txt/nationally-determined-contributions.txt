The chart illustrates the progress of the world's nations in submitting their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which are plans for reducing national emissions and adapting to climate change as per the Paris Agreement. As of 2023, the data demonstrates that a total of 194 countries have submitted their first NDCs, indicating initial commitment levels to combat climate change. However, only 17 of these countries have proceeded to update their contributions by submitting their second NDCs. The vast difference between the number of first submissions and second submissions underscores a significant gap in updates to these national plans, suggesting a potential delay in escalating efforts to tackle climate change consistently, as countries are required to revise and communicate new NDCs every five years.

The chart presents the age-standardized death rates from snakebite envenoming per 100,000 people for various countries in 2019. It shows a stark contrast in the fatality rates across different regions. Of the listed countries, India and Somalia have significantly higher death rates, with India at 4.0 and Somalia leading at 4.5. In comparison, the Central African Republic records a mortality rate of 3.44, which is also substantially high, but lower than Somalia and India. On the other end of the spectrum, countries like China, France, and the United States have the lowest recorded rates, at just 0.01. Brazil and Indonesia have slightly higher rates at 0.11 and 0.09, respectively, while South Africa has an even lower rate of 0.04. The global average death rate stands at 0.81, which indicates that while some countries have managed to achieve much lower rates than this average, others, particularly Somalia and India, face a significantly higher risk of fatalities due to snakebites.

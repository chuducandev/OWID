The chart presents the average income trends of small-scale food producers in Canada from 2001 to 2016, with all figures adjusted for inflation and cost of living differences and denominated in purchasing power parity (PPP) international dollars of 2017. The data reflect a negative income, indicating that small-scale food producers were, on average, operating at a loss over the period. Specifically, their losses started at approximately -4794 PPP dollars in 2001 and showed little change by 2006, with an average income at around -4802 PPP dollars. A noticeable improvement occurred between 2006 and 2011, with losses reducing to about -4347 PPP dollars. This trend of diminishing losses continued through to 2016, where the average income loss decreased significantly to approximately -2388 PPP dollars. These figures suggest a gradual improvement over the years in the economic conditions of small-scale food producers in Canada, at least in terms of their income measured in constant international dollars.

In 2021, the percentage of firms with a female top manager varied significantly across different world regions. Latin America and the Caribbean led with the highest proportion at 20.1%, followed closely by Europe and Central Asia at approximately 17.9%. These rates reflect a near or above-average presence of women in top management roles when compared to the worldwide average of 17.9%. Sub-Saharan Africa also showed a notable representation at 16.2%. In contrast, South Asia and the Middle East and North Africa had considerably lower percentages, with 11% and 6.5%, respectively. The latter region reflects the least gender diversity in top leadership positions among the data presented. These figures highlight persistent regional disparities in gender representation in the top tiers of management within firms globally.

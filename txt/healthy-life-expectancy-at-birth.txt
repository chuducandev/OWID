The chart presents the worldwide trend in Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) at birth for both sexes from the year 2000 to 2019. There has been a steady increase in the years of life expected to be lived free from disability or disease burden. In the year 2000, the global average HALE at birth was approximately 58.34 years. By 2010, this figure had risen to around 61.53 years, marking an increase of over 3 years within that decade. The upward trend continued, with the Healthy Life Expectancy reaching nearly 62.94 years in 2015. By 2019, the average HALE at birth further improved to approximately 63.70 years. The data clearly indicates that over the span of nearly two decades, there has been a consistent improvement in the expected years of healthy living at birth, suggesting advancements in global health measures, medical technologies, and perhaps improvements in living conditions and healthcare access across the world.

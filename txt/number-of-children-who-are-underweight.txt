The provided chart depicts the trend in the number of underweight children in India from 1989 to 2017. Starting in 1989 with approximately 67.49 million underweight children, there was a fluctuating decline over the years, with a notable decrease to around 49.3 million by 1997. However, this progress was partially lost as the numbers rose again to approximately 60.02 million by 1999. Although there were ups and downs, the overall trend continued downward, reaching about 36.62 million in 2014 before rising slightly to 44.68 million in 2015. The final data point in 2017 shows another decline, with the number of underweight children at approximately 40.24 million. Despite some year-to-year variations, the long-term trend indicates a substantial reduction of over 27 million underweight children over the span of 28 years.

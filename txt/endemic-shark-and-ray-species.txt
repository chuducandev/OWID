The chart illustrates the number of endemic shark and ray species for select countries as of 2020. Endemic species are defined as species unique to a single geographic location; in this context, within the exclusive economic zone of a country's coastal boundaries. Australia stands out as an extraordinary hotspot for marine biodiversity, with a total of 146 endemic shark and ray speciesâ€”far surpassing other listed countries. Following Australia, New Zealand harbors 26 endemic species, while Brazil comes third with 21 species. Indonesia and Japan also have notable numbers with 18 and 14 species, respectively. South Africa and the United States are tied, each hosting 13 endemic species. Colombia has the fewest on the list, with only 2 endemic shark and ray species. The data, sourced from the IUCN Red List, highlights the localized nature of marine biodiversity and underscores the ecological uniqueness of Australia's coastal waters with respect to these marine creatures.

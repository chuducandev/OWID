The chart presents the average number of power outages that firms experience in a typical month in 2021, categorized by the income level of countries. The data shows a clear correlation between a country's income level and the frequency of power outages in firms. High-income countries experience the least number of outages, averaging less than one (<1) outage per month. This contrasts starkly with low-income countries, where firms face an average of approximately 10.6 outages per month, representing the highest frequency among the categories. Lower-middle-income countries also experience a high number of outages, with an average of approximately 8.8 per month. Upper-middle-income countries, while better off than their low and lower-middle-income counterparts, still experience a moderate level of outages, averaging around 2.8 per month. The data illustrates the challenges faced by firms in lower-income countries regarding reliable power supply, impacting their operations and economic stability.

The chart presents the number of catheterization laboratories (cath labs) per million people for various countries as of 2016 or 2017. Germany leads with a significant margin, boasting 11.8 cath labs per million people, emphasizing its robust healthcare infrastructure for heart-related diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Italy and Switzerland follow with 7.3 and 7.2 labs per million people respectively, reflecting their well-equipped facilities for cardiovascular care. Middle-range countries include Greece with 6.2, Denmark with 5.4, and Sweden and France both with exactly 5.0 labs per million people, indicating good but less dense cath lab availability compared to the top-tier countries. The United Kingdom and Spain are slightly lower at 4.7 labs per million people. On the lower end of the spectrum, Romania and Egypt have 2.5 and 1.3 labs per million people, respectively, signalling limited access to such specialized facilities. Notably, the data for Turkey is from 2017, with 4.6 cath labs per million, similar to the lower-middle range of the 2016 data set.

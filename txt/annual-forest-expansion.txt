The chart presents the progression of annual forest expansion globally from 1990 to 2015. It shows a pattern of fluctuating forest growth over the years, with an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease. The world saw its highest annual forest expansion in the year 2000, reaching 10 million hectares. After reaching this peak, the expansion rate began to decline, slipping to 7 million hectares in 2010 and further decreasing to 5 million hectares by 2015. This trend indicates that while there was a significant drive for afforestation and natural forest growth around the turn of the century, efforts seem to have waned in the following decade, leading to less annual forest gain in more recent years.

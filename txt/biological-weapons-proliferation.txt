The chart provides a stark illustration of the global stance on biological weapons as of the year 2022. It reveals that the vast majority of countries, 193 in total, neither pursue nor possess biological weapons. These weapons are defined as organisms or toxins intended to cause death or harm through their poisonous properties. On the other hand, a very small number, just 4 countries, are allegedly pursuing biological weapons. This information, however, comes with a caveat as the allegations have not been confirmed by the countries themselves or any impartial observers. The significant disparity between the two numbers suggests a widespread international consensus against the possession and development of biological weapons.

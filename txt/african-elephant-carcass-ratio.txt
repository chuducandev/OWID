The chart displays the African elephant carcass ratio by country in 2015, an indicator used to assess the proportion of dead elephants observed during survey counts against the estimated total population, with carcass ratios above 8% suggesting a declining population. Cameroon exhibits an alarming ratio of 83%, far surpassing other nations and indicating a critical conservation crisis. Mozambique and Angola also show notably high carcass ratios of 32% and 30%, respectively, pointing towards significant declines in elephant populations. On the lower end of the spectrum, Uganda has the smallest ratio of merely 0.5%, suggesting a stable or growing elephant population. Botswana and Malawi, with ratios of 7% and 2%, are lower than the 8% threshold that sparks conservation concern, which could indicate healthier elephant populations. The average carcass ratio for the whole of Africa is recorded at 11.9%, which is above the threshold, hinting at a continent-wide concern for the elephant populations.

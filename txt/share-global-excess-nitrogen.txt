The chart presents the distribution of global excess nitrogen from croplands among different countries in the year 2009. Excess nitrogen is defined as the surplus nitrogen from the agricultural sector that is not absorbed by crops and thus becomes a pollutant, potentially causing environmental harm. China stands out as the largest contributor to this issue, accounting for a staggering 32.81% of the world's excess nitrogen from croplands. India follows with a significant share of 17.95%, highlighting the substantial impact of these two populous nations on global nitrogen pollution. The United States is also a notable contributor with 10.67%. Brazil and Mexico have smaller shares of 2.78% and 2.14% respectively. Contributions from the United Kingdom and South Africa are minimal in this context, each accounting for less than 0.5%. The data underscores the importance of efficient fertilizer use and the need for strategies to minimize environmental damage from agricultural practices in highly populated and agriculturally intensive countries.

The chart presents the partial correlation between life satisfaction and mental illness across four different countries in 2017, as sourced from Clark et al. in the World Happiness Report. Negative values indicate that higher levels of reported mental illness correspond to lower levels of reported life satisfaction after accounting for differences in income, education, marital status, physical illness, employment status, and gender. The United States exhibits the strongest such negative correlation at -0.21, suggesting a more substantial inverse relationship between mental illness and life satisfaction compared to the other countries listed. Following the United States, Australia shows a correlation of -0.18. The United Kingdom has a somewhat weaker negative correlation at -0.11. Indonesia stands out with the lowest negative correlation among the cited countries at -0.07, which implies that the relationship between mental illness and life satisfaction is less pronounced than in the other nations included in the analysis.

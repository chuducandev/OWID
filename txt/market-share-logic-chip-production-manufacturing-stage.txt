In 2021, the United States held a dominant position in the design phase of logic chip production with a 61% market share, far surpassing other countries. Taiwan, on the other hand, was the leading country in both the fabrication and assembly, testing, and packaging stages, with 47% and 29% market shares respectively. China also showed notable involvement across all three stages, with market shares of 9%, 12%, and 14% in design, fabrication, and assembly/testing/packaging respectively. South Korea was particularly active in fabrication and assembly with 11% and 13% market shares, while Japan's involvement was relatively minor in comparison, especially in fabrication with only a 1% share. Italy and Malaysia each had a small presence in specific stages; Italy in fabrication (2%) and Malaysia in assembly, testing, and packaging (2%). The combined efforts of the remaining countries ("Others") contributed to 9% of the design phase and 5% of the assembly/testing/packaging phase, but no significant involvement in the fabrication stage is noted in the chart.

The chart presents data on the borrowing habits of Sudanese adults aged 15 and older in 2011. The most common source for borrowing was family or friends, with a substantial 47.36% of adults reporting this method. This is indicative of a strong reliance on personal networks over formal financial institutions for financial support. Borrowing from stores by buying on credit was also relatively common, involving 31.83% of adults, suggesting the prevalence of informal credit arrangements in the retail sector.

Conversely, formal borrowing from financial institutions was particularly low, with only 1.76% of adults using this channel, which points to a potentially limited access to or trust in formal banking services. Personal borrowing from employers was used by 11.24% of adults, while borrowing from private informal lenders accounted for 11.1%, highlighting the importance of alternative, non-bank borrowing options. Overall, the figures underscore a heavy reliance on informal borrowing mechanisms amongst adults in Sudan during the year 2011.

In Madagascar for the year 2010, the share of non-essential products in total household consumption as cataloged by the World Bank Global Consumption Database saw tobacco as the largest share at 2.31%, followed by alcohol at 0.54%, and lastly games of chance which occupied a minute portion at just 0.03%. The data underscores that among these non-essential categories, tobacco was the most significant expenditure for households, amounting to more than four times the share of alcohol and markedly greater than games of chance. It's important to note that these figures arise from surveys conducted and may reflect differences due to the survey design, methodology, and the time when they were conducted, suggesting that comparisons should be approached with caution.

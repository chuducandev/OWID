The chart illustrates the amount of marine species discarded by different types of fishing gear in the year 2014. Discards refer to marine animals that are thrown back into the sea, whether alive or dead, after being caught as bycatch during fishing activities. The data reveals a significant disparity in the amount of discards amongst various fishing gear types. Bottom trawls accounted for the largest proportion of discards, at approximately 4.16 million tonnes, indicating the high bycatch rate associated with this fishing method. Seine nets resulted in the second-highest volume of discards, with 1.54 million tonnes. Midwater trawls and gillnets also contributed notably to the total discards, with 940,031 tonnes and 793,102 tonnes respectively. On the lower end of the scale, longline gear accounted for discards amounting to 356,373 tonnes, while the boat dredge gear had the least impact with 198,365 tonnes. The data from other types of gear combined to a figure of 626,138 tonnes. The vast majority of discards can be attributed to the more industrial and large-scale fishing methods like bottom trawls and seine nets, indicating the environmental cost of these practices.

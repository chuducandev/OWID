The chart illustrates the anticipated impact of habitat loss on various animal species as a result of agricultural expansion by the year 2050. Under a business-as-usual scenario, a substantial number of species are projected to lose significant portions of their habitat. A total of 1,267 species are expected to lose more than 25% of their habitat, which represents the broadest impact across the categories presented. As the severity of habitat loss intensifies, the number of affected species decreases but still signifies major concern. Specifically, 343 species are at risk of losing more than 50% of their habitat, while 94 species might see a decline in habitat of more than 75%. Alarmingly, 32 species face an extreme risk of losing over 90% of their habitat which can severely threaten their chances of survival. Each of these figures encapsulates a critical level of reduction in natural habitats that could have profound implications for biodiversity and ecosystem services globally.
